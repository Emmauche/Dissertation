# Data transformation
# The objective is to end up with a tidy table inside Spark with one row per word used. The steps will be:
  
# The needed data transformations apply to the data from both authors. The data sets will be appended to one another
# Punctuation will be removed
# The words inside each line will be separated, or tokenized
# For a cleaner analysis, stop words will be removed
# To tidy the data, each word in a line will become its own row
# The results will be saved to Spark memory

# Topic Modelling
#  LDA is a type of topic model for identifying abstract “topics” in a set of documents. 
# It is an unsupervised algorithm in that we do not provide any labels, or topics, for the input documents. 
# LDA posits that each document is a mixture of topics, and each topic is a mixture of words.
# During training, it attempts to estimate both of these simultaneously. 
# A typical use case for topic models involves categorizing many documents,
# for which the large number of documents renders manual approaches infeasible.
# The application domains range from GitHub issues to legal documents.
# For example we have:

# Chapter 4. Relationships Between Words: N-grams and Correlations
# So far we’ve considered words as individual units, and considered their relationships to sentiments or to documents. However, many interesting text analyses are based on the relationships between words, whether examining which words tend to follow others immediately, or words that tend to co-occur within the same documents.

# In this chapter, we’ll explore some of the methods tidytext offers for calculating and visualizing relationships between words in your text dataset. This includes the token = "ngrams" argument, which tokenizes by pairs of adjacent words rather than by individual ones. We’ll also introduce two new packages: ggraph, by Thomas Pedersen, which extends ggplot2 to construct network plots, and widyr, which calculates pairwise correlations and distances within a tidy data frame. Together these expand our toolbox for exploring text within the tidy data framework.

# spark streaming
# A good way of looking at the way how Spark streams update is as a three stage operation:
# Input - Spark reads the data inside a given folder. The folder is expected to contain multiple data files, with new files being created containing the most current stream data.
# Processing - Spark applies the desired operations on top of the data. These operations could be data manipulations (dplyr, SQL), data transformations (sdf operations, PipelineModel predictions), or native R manipulations (spark_apply()).
# Output - The results of processing the input files are saved in a different folder.
