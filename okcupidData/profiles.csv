<br />
books<br />
i am constantly reading something. what else are you going to do in
those daily gaps in your life? (don't say ""internet."") anyway,
reading is magical, like tapping into the brain of a person you'll
probably never meet. here's what i've read recently:<br />
really dense, boring, scientifically accurate scifi<br />
had a(n) historical non fiction kick for a while<br />
read this teen romance novel that made me cry<br />
finally read some chuck klosterman to find out what everybody back
in college was talking about<br />
now i'm reading some mark twain<br />
i'd really like to read some contemporary fiction next, something
good that affects me. like maybe you should message me if you have
suggestions because reading suggestions are the best.<br />
<br />
movies<br />
firstly, bad movies. i cannot get enough of bad movies. i might
have a fetish for digital rips of color-bled vhs tapes. 80s kung
fu, 70s scifi, godzilla, gamera, the blob, anything with a budget
around 1000 dollars that takes place in outer space, you get the
idea. message me if you want to have an everything is terrible or
mystery science theatre 3000 night. even if you suck it would
probably make my week.<br />
i do love a good, slow paced art movie though. early 60s mystery
and late 60s heist films are my new kick. movies that build up my
anticipation, or make me hold my breath, or scare me with what i'm
not allowed to see are the best.<br />
ever notice that romantic comedies and comedy commodes are either
great or awful? well anyway, thankfully i enjoy both great and
awful movies, but don't ever expect me to shut up about what i
thought about em. including during the movie, constantly, if it's
bad.<br />
oh and documentaries! i watch documentaries constantly. you always
learn, and sometimes they're really haunting, you know?<br />
<br />
okay now this is getting too long and no one will ever read it. see
what happens when i update this stupid profile sober?<br />
<br />
music<br />
either a girl with an acoustic guitar singing her heart out or a
guy behind a synth mumbling in dark monotone<br />
<br />
tv<br />
...is hours-long movies, so see above. also stop watching tv. don't
message me if you don't notice laugh tracks.<br />

me gusta ver bailar a los viejos. me encantara probar llevar de
esos zapatos que tienen rueditas en los talones, pero seguro que me
caera y me partira el cuello. me entristece ver a los

<br />
a) most recently, *this is your brain on music*, by daniel j.
levitin. even the title confirms how i respond addictively to
hearing and making music.<br />
<br />
*the stuff of thought*, by steven pinker. this guy is so smart and
touches on so many other fields of human endeavor that his name
turns up in about half the books i read these days.<br />
<br />
*when you are engulfed in flames*, by david sedaris. may his
typewriter's ribbon never tear (because he refuses to use a
computer).<br />
<br />
before that, *the lovely bones* by alice sebold. i can't quite
decide if i like magical realism generally, but she does it in an
unintrusive way, letting her characters express emotions more
genuinely than in anything i can recall reading.<br />
<br />
*the god delusion*, by richard dawkins<br />
*breaking the spell*, by daniel c. dennett (okay, i think about
religion a lot, critically [in both senses of the term])<br />
*in defense of food*, by michael pollan<br />
*the omnivore's dilemma*, by michael pollan<br />
*the botany of desire*, by michael pollan (okay, i think about food
a lot...)<br />
*guns, germs and steel*, by jared diamond<br />
*collapse*, by jared diamond<br />
*out of gas: the end of the age of oil*, by david l. goodstein
(really, i'm not nearly as dour as all these titles make me out to
be...)<br />
*a people's history of the united states*, by howard zinn<br />
*freakonomics*, by steven d. levitt and stephen j. dubner<br />
*the tipping point*, by malcolm gladwell<br />
*the culture of fear*, by barry glassner<br />
*the left hand of darkness* by ursula k. le guin<br />
*a time of changes* by robert silverberg<br />
*the tripods*, by john christopher<br />
*the salmon of doubt*, by douglas adams (particularly the essay ""is
there an artificial god?"")<br />
*lolita*, by vladimir nabakov<br />
*a confederacy of dunces* by john kennedy o'toole<br />
*le ton beau de marot*, by douglas hofstadter<br />
*the language instinct*, by steven pinker<br />
*words and rules*, by steven pinker<br />

*galaxy quest*<br />
*wordplay*<br />
*ratatouille*<br />
*the apartment*<br />
*the incredibles*<br />
*the lives of others*<br />
i watched entirely too much tv until i was 25. after that, i hardly
watched any, with the exception of *the simpsons* and *south park*,
and then only in reruns. but then i signed up with netflix, which
allows one to watch tv shows without actually watching them the way
that broadcasters want you to: with ads. since then, i've become
engrossed in ""the west wing"", ""deadwood"" and ""futurama"".<br />
<br />
c) (okay, with music, i felt inspired to be more complete: i dipped
into my itunes for a list and collated it with the list of stuff i
still have to transfer from tape to digital. for no good reason, i
present it here in order of line length.)<br />

paraphrasing here): if someone's grandparents (not necessarily
yours or mine) wouldn't recognize it as food, don't eat it. what we

of) traditional diets from around the world. this makes them both

here are some possibilities:<br />
1.) love. i'm open to feeling and expressing love if we're highly
compatible intellectually, emotionally and sexually. (i've already
got a primary partner, so if i were to embark in this direction
with someone, the relationship would never include
cohabitation.)<br />
2.) friendship and sex. much like the above, but neither of us
feels inspired to use the l-word.<br />
3.) fuck-buddies. we respect each other; we like each other well
enough to spend two or three hours together getting our rocks off
(once a week?/month?/year? -- it all depends...). i can have this
kind of relationship pretty easily. it does require great sexual
chemistry and zero drama.<br />

either of the other possibilities.","having dinner with my wife and son, wishing them a shabat shalom

people often ask me what ethnicity i am.","i am more of a non fiction reader than a fiction reader. i like
reading about actual things rather than novels. i have been wanting
to get more into novels because i always hear about people not
being able to put books down, but they just do not grab me for some
reason.<br />
<br />
the same goes for movies to some extent. i love documentaries and
do not have a problem admitting i like reality tv shows. you have
to admit- its getting hard to avoid them these days. i do, however,
like a good drama, chick flick, or comedy when the mood strikes.

""and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you
make""<br />
the above line is my favorite quote of all time because it's how i
try and live my life. while i'm far from perfect, it's an ideal
that i strive for.<br />
i'm a college graduate with a history major and i'm trying to find
my way in life. i currently work part time (but usually get full
time hours) in retail, but am looking for bigger and better
things.<br />
i've lived in the bay area for just over a year now and have
enjoyed my time up here so far.<br />
people generally think of me as a nice guy (i've been accused of
being too nice by some). i tend not to take myself too seriously.
i've got a good sense of humor and can be sarcastic when the
occasion calls for it.<br />
i'm honest and fairly straight forward. i can be loyal to a fault.
i'm a bit of a hopeless romantic, chivalrous, generous and look to
help others when possible. i'm fairly laid back and am not quick to
anger.<br />
when you first meet me, i will come off as a shy guy, but once i
get to know someone, i open up a lot and go from being an introvert
to a bit of an extrovert.<br />
i've also been accused of being a smartass, which i tend to agree
with, i do think that my behind is quite brilliant.<br />
i love animals, but i'm definitely a dog person. i do like cats,
however, i am allergic to some.<br />
i'm a hard worker and hate to be late, but i also love to kick
back.<br />
i'm a geek, and enjoy sci-fi and fantasy, with the original star
wars trilogy being my favorite movies (followed very closely by the
princess bride). i'm a gamer and enjoy playing with others as well
as alone. i also enjoy reading comics.<br />
i'm a bit of an oddity, i was born and raised in socal, and am
about as much of a hardcore hockey fan as you can find (and no, my
family isn't canadian). the anaheim ducks are my favorite team, but
i'll watch any team play if i have the time, hockey is just an
amazing sport to watch. i'm also incredibly excited that the echl
will be moving a hockey team to san francisco starting next
season!<br />
i love to read, and lose countless hours of sleep to it every
week.<br />
i enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and soccer, but i haven't played
much of either one lately. i'm always up for tossing a disc around
with a friend.<br />
i enjoy going to movies, and get groups together to go to midnight
showings whenever possible.<br />
there are times when i enjoy the company of an animal (usually a
dog, but cats and others sometimes as well) more than the company
of a person. this happens for 1 of 2 reasons. first of all, i
communicate well with dogs and most tend to really like me. second,
when i'm really down, there are few things that bring a smile back
to my face like when i'm playing with a dog.<br />
for you movie and tv fans, there are a few characters that i
identify with decently to fairly well. they range from luke to mal
to simon to castle to westley to perrin (bonus points if you know
who every single one of these characters are). basically, a couple
of farmboys combined with a difficulty in talking to girls combined
with a hopeless romantic combined with an odd sense of honor and
loyalty.","figuring out what comes next and trying to enjoy what i have right
now.<br />
also, i'm planning on winning the lottery someday. i don't know how
or when this will happen, but i have decided that it will happen.","remembering things, kicking ass in smash bros, reading, being loyal
and honest, playing with puppies, card games (poker, gin, war,
egyptian rat screw, hearts, pretty much anything you can teach me),
board games (clue and sorry are my all time favorites), my job,
learning new things, being a supportive friend, quoting movies and
tv (notably star wars, firefly, princess bride, and anything mel
brooks), listening to people (i'm not really sure how good i am at
this, but people seem to think i am), minesweeper, air hockey,
making my friends laugh, being a jungle gym for my young cousins","i've been told my smile (by one of my roommates but i'm not sure i
believe them), so i'll leave it to you to let me know (but i'd
guess my curly hair)","books - wheel of time, lord of the rings, harry potter, star wars,
dragoncrown war cycle, america: the book, ender's game, the
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, killer angels, we were soldiers

things they carried, good omens, world war z, dune, naked pictures

games - ocarina of time, final fantasy vii, the metal gear solid

knights of the old republic, batman: arkham asylum, infamous<br />
<br />
food - steak, chicken, pasta, chines, italian, sushi, pizza, reeses","family and friends, hockey, dogs, books, movies, and video games","anything and everything. if i have an interest in something,
chances are i'll spend time thinking about it. whether it's the
last book i read, why lucas made greedo shoot first, how much fun
hockey is to watch, what my friends and family are doing, metal
gear solid, and whatever else catches my fancy.","these days i'm typically at work, but if i had my choice, i'd be
relaxing with friends, at a hockey game, at the movies, reading
(seriously, there are times when i read a disgusting amount of the
time), or playing games with friends.","there are two things i'm willing to say here. the 1st concert i
ever went to was for the backstreet boys way back when. we had a
foreign exchange student at the time, and she was a huge fan and i
got dragged along.<br />
secondly, i've been known to tear up during movies, ranging from
the lion king to toy story 2 (yes, 2, not 3, i cried during that
too, but so did everyone else) to up (i was pretty much a wet rag
for the 2nd half of that movie) to finding neverland. a good, sad
movie will bring tears to my eyes.","if you're a fellow geek and/or hockey nut. if you want to hang out
and catch a movie or play a game. if you want to just sit and chat.
if you want to toss a frisbee around (hopefully i'm not too rusty).
if you want to bitch and moan at fox for cancelling firefly. if
you're planning on going to the midnight showing of the avengers
and/or the dark knight rises this summer. if you've ever looked to
yoda for advice and/or followed the jedi code.<br />
or, if you just want to chat with a nice guy, who is open to
meeting new people. you don't have to be a geek to be my friend,
you don't have to be cool to rule my world. i love meeting new
people.<br />

tweeter and the monkey man is one of the best songs ever) and think
they are criminally underrated because people don't know about
them. or if you want to get to know an amazing band with some of
the greatest musicians of recent times (seriously, it's made up of
lynne, dylan, petty, harrison, and orbison).<br />

<br />
i tend not to like to summarize, as a i really dislike being
typecast. i'm happiest when i'm learning, and have really broad
interests--it's always a struggle to find balance and fulfillment
among intellectual/idealistic/artistic/athletic pursuits. my
academic interests have tended to involve international studies
(law/politics/econ), but also international lit.<br />
<br />
but i'm pretty content to be in the bay these days. i'm pretty well
traveled, at least in the western hemisphere. have studied and
lived abroad in various places--budapest/chile/buenos aires.<br />
<br />
i'd like to think of myself as pretty humble and fair-minded, but i
also enjoy arguing a bit. rest assured that it's nothing personal.
my friends inevitably tend to have strong opinions and relate to
the world intellectually--they are creative lawyer types,
scientists, artists.<br />
<br />
sense of humor is deadpan, with absurd highlights and a smidge of
snark--but only when you have it coming ;)<br />
<br />
i'm generally suspicious of archetypes, but if infj means anything
attractive to you, then perhaps i'm your huckleberry.","career-wise, i gravitate towards work that i get to feel good
about: social justice at home and abroad, environmental law.
work-life balance is important to me--my union lawyer gig suits me
pretty well, at least for the moment. i've worked in a lot of
different areas: helping draft constitutions in developing
countries, managing after-school programs for kids, working in
sound tech, to name just a few.<br />
<br />
in my free time, i like to get down, play capoeira, and watch an
occasional soccer game. i spend a lot of time hiking in the east
bay's regional parks with my pup, and love backpacking.<br />
<br />
i also enjoy tinkering around the house, building virtual machines,
planting shit, people-watching.","problem solving, writing, most anything athletic.","eyes, legs, wit. in that order.","i'm partial to satires, brilliant prose, and pretty much any art
that can get the wheels turning in my head. favorite authors
include salman rushdie, victor pelevin. i seem to really like early
20th century german literature.<br />
<br />
fave filmmakers would be: tarkovsky, coen bros, jp jeunet,
kusturica, miyazaki, greenaway, wenders, etc etc.<br />
<br />
fave music: i tend to digest a lot of music, and am a bit of a
musical novelty seeker, so originality and complexity are good
qualities: battles, grizzly bear, animal collective, most anything
on warp records or ninja tune. this could be a very long
list.<br />
<br />

 friedrich nietzsche<br />
humans  who enslave, castrate, experiment on, and fillet other
animals  have had an understandable penchant for pretending
animals do not feel pain. a sharp distinction between humans and
'animals' is essential if we are to bend them to our will, make
them work for us, wear them, eat them  without any disquieting
tinges of guilt or regret. it is unseemly of us, who often behave
so unfeelingly toward other animals, to contend that only humans
can suffer. the behavior of other animals renders such pretensions
specious. they are just too much like us.<br />

cheered for the s.f. giants. i'm passionate about the earth and all
her beauty and children. especially her children. my dream is to
live in a just and abundant world of love and beauty. but
alas!<br />
i'm easy going and emphatic, also emotionally present and aware of
others and their needs and feelings and respect their
boundaries.<br />
i'd like to meet a man who is light hearted and has time to smell
the roses. likes to laugh as i do-- but can be deep and passionate
in a healthy honest way. fearless about being straight forward and
honest as i am. i'm a perfectionist, but love the imperfection of
the perfection. that's funny too.","a lot. besides hugging my grand baby i'm listening to great music,
walking in the fantastic east bay parks, finishing my 3rd book,
(hopefully) dancing to upbeat rythyms, (well, not as much as
formerly)putting together my photography collection in a show with
music and poetry. attempting. it's a process. moving slowly
whenever possible and hoping to meet someone special.<br />

enjoying life!","you need to ask them. probably that i laugh outloud.","i don't have a favorite book. i have hundreds of favorite books.

<br />
i am an expat living in san francisco for the last 8 years. before
then i lived in england for 8 years and before then was in scotland
where i was born. i spent a few months in bolivia after college
too. all and all i am pretty aware of what is going on in the world
today and am interested in people who are interested in the world,
not just with what is going on in this land.<br />
<br />
i have a good life with great friends, a great home, a great job
and i am healthy. i am a happy guy and am both light hearted and
thoughtful. i have a strong set of values which include hard work,
discipline, sacrifice, love, family, education, trust, nature,
active listening, humbleness, intellectual curiosity, honesty,
laughter and joy, spirituality and passion.<br />
<br />
while i am always open to new friends, i am really looking for a
new best friend, partner and lover. i am looking for someone who
shares many of my values but also compliments those with their own
special values.<br />
<br />
certain of my values definitely come from my upbringing in
scotland. while my life is balanced here, with the right partner
and plan, i would be up for exploring more of this amazing earth on
a short or long-term basis. my new partner will definitely
appreciate european ways (other than the accent)......hopefully you
know what that means!<br />
<br />
love and laughter!","in my days i work at my career in real estate. i am a senior
professional at a respected company and really enjoy what i do.
that job gives me financial stability which takes off much pressure
in my life. i own and live in a lovely non-conventional condo in
mission bay (more artistic than cookie-cutter) and i have plenty of
vacation allowance to use up each year. i really do leave my work
at the door and spend the rest of my time checking out new places
to eat in sf, acting the fool and being playful, taking in movies,
occasional but not enough live theater hanging with friends,
inventing and doing random creative projects, enjoying parks in sf
during the summer, hitting music festivals, finding remote natural
hot tubs, camping, drinking whisky (scottish) and wine too much or
not enough, hiking and more. i love getting in the car and hitting
the road!<br />
<br />
keeping fit and being active is very important to me for many
reasons. i go through phases of what i do.......yoga, pilates,
gyrotonics, swimming.....and most so rolling around on my exercise
ball while watching soccer in the mornings. i used to rock climb
and run more, and perhaps one day will again. paddle boarding is
something i want to try in 2012. first goal is to work on healing
up an achilles tendon injury....more ultrasound and ice please,
doctor! so frustrating.......but i must be zen.<br />
<br />
working on the spiritual side of life and my heart are have been a
focus for the last 5 years. i ain't no hippie and i was born with a
cynical streak, but i am open to new things and pursue them with
more regularity these days. i make an annual pilgrimage to meet a
native indian in arizon and walk into the desert after eating his
special cactus and i go to a meditation thingie twice a week. these
things help me stay in the present and trust that all will be
ok!<br />
<br />
other than that, i am now looking at real estate investment
opportunities in the inner mission with a friend. that is a hobby
that is fun and fruitful (i hope). i am also working to promote
electric bicycles in the bay area (www.yubaride.com), and as of
this week now helping out a friend on their initiative to build a
cacao farm in hawaii....did you know that kuaii is the only place
in america you can grow cacao and thus make american-made
chocolate?","i am really good at balancing out my life and taking pleasure in
the simple things in life. i am also really good at doing stupid
things due not concentrating or daydreaming. thankfully these
stupid things make for others entertainment, so overall it is a win
me thinks!","people initially notice that i am tall and talk funny. 100% that is
the first two. but very soon after that they realize that i make

raiders of the lost ark, get him to the greek, raging bull, rocky,
inglorious basterds, jacob's ladder, midnight in paris.<br />
shows: curb your enthusiasm, spartacus, sons or anarchy, anything
ricky gervais. don't watch much tv, but i do watch soccer and
boxing.<br />
food: i love all food apart from junk food. defo a tendnacy for

transplanted new yorker who came to ca for grad school and never
left... the new yorker is still alive and well. a working class kid
who knows where he came from. my values are working class; do the
right thing and don't be afraid of hard work. if you're my
friend/companion, i'll always have your back. if you're a princess,
i'm not a prince. i prefer down to earth no bs people who have
created a place in this world. i'm a happy guy blessed with great
kids &amp; a good friend who's my ex. separated and winding down as
i support her career moves. no drama. not getting married again, no
longer need the paper...and i like all my stuff ;). if you need a

i will be there.<br />

vines... go for morning runs. not all in the same day... and
work.<br />
i travel to enjoy art &amp; the local culture (picasso, miro,
braque, matisse), explore the early morning streets of rome, paris,
barcelona &amp; central park and try to learn a little more about
life. i teach &amp; i coach because i've been blessed and its a way
of giving back. i support my family, friends, my kids and my ex in

for great parents and try to emulate their skills... i don't always

both places and live in sf, but spend as many weeks of the summer
as possible in the traverse city/ petoskey, michigan region.
summers are for swimming and floating (preferably all day), and
sun-setting (still haven't seen more than one/ day), and
niece-throwing (into a lake, geez!), and bonfires (be certain to
keep the nieces out of those).<br />
<br />
i'm athletic when presented with a sport, but i'm a klutz in my
daily life. i was once bought a sippy cup because i am prone to
knocking over the glasses of water i leave everywhere, and would do
well to replace it. i'm definitely adventurous, both domestically
and out-of-doors. i probably own too many shoes, but not enough
camera lenses. anyone want to trade?<br />
<br />
i love easily and consider myself passionate - for a ratiocinative,
anyway:). my politics are quite left of center. i've been described
as having a logical mind, but i hold emotional intelligence and
compassion in higher esteem. i find the most interesting colors
intermingled with thoughtful shades of gray.","helping under-served people with whatever gifts i've been given,
changing careers, spending time with the people i love. i moved to
san francisco because i enjoyed it immensely when visiting, and my
life in michigan was ripe for change.<br />
<br />
i used to play the sax and coach volleyball, but most of the past
10 years of my work life have been dedicated to mental health
social work. i have an mba with an emphasis on nonprofit management
(undergrad in psych), and i currently work with teens who have
disabilities and behavioral issues. my teaching certification is
next on the list, and i hope to have my own classroom sometime in
the next two years.<br />
<br />
romantically: partnership is a truly lovely thing to have, but i
feel complete with or without it. i'm ready - and looking forward
to - falling in love again, but do not want to try to fit dating
partners into a preconceived mold. let's meet and move forward from
there. i've found kindness and honesty to be the best guides when
shaping relationships, and have no interest in dating people who
have trouble practicing both. if you need to compartmentalize your
relationships and loves, please work that out before contacting me
:).","teaching, collecting wool socks, spatial and abstract
relationships, floating in bodies of water, talking about difficult
subjects, dropping things, snagging things i've dropped before they
hit the ground, making up stories for my nieces and nephew, empathy
and mediation. i'm resourceful, for example: using that last piece
of gum to hold my wiper blade on its arm during a downpour, or
helping put together a network of health care workers to provide a
free clinic.","my smile? my politics? my relationships with chickpeas and cereal?
lately several people have commented on my physical demeanor.","i'm going to ignore this prompt and put forth some random facts

this section is like chewing broken glass.<br />

shocking!). somewhere along the way i got bitten by the 'startup

relationship. so i'm very slowly dipping my little toe into the
dating pool. i think i'm window shopping, but i'm not ready to go
into the store yet.<br />
<br />
that said, a friendly cup of coffee where there is resonance may be
a possibility, and who knows what the future holds?<br />
<br />
at this point, i not only view a relationship in terms of what is
given or received in the moment between the two people in question,
but also in terms of what sort of effect is created in the world
with the other person, through our connection - the bird's eye
view, so to speak. this is what will remain in the end, after
all.<br />
<br />
i'm committing my life to personal integrity and being the best,
strongest person i can be. i'm ultimately interested in building a
connection with a person who shares those values. i would like to
create through my connection with another person, a sense of
inspiration and mutual support and encouragement. i would also like
for our connection to have a the ability to provide an uplift to
others we may interact with, as well as a sense of fun, joy,
groundedness, compassion, celebration.<br />
<br />
so what does this look like? i appreciate men who are are
available, kind, dependable, consistent, and willing to do whatever
it takes to communicate through the hard stuff, as well as show up
for the fun and joy.<br />
<br />
in return, i'm compassionate and kind, curious and respectful. i am
comfortable with people being themselves. i find that i can be
accepting of many things, provided that there is clear
communication and respect underlying our interactions.<br />
<br />
i believe in going slowly, and ultimately, i'm looking for a
relationship of quality that evolves from honesty, compassion, and
awareness.<br />
<br />
i experience divinity in all things, and have little use for
organized religion, aside from retreats, music events, or cultural
activities. i'm not looking to date an atheist or agnostic, since
we won't share a common language about something i consider quite
core.<br />
<br />
i'm intuitive, direct, balanced, and health-oriented. i'm deep and
a goofball - i love to laugh. i'm a bit of a tomboyish music geek
in the sense that when i jam with my guy friends, i am one of the
guys. when i'm on a date with you, i'm all about looking to get my
needs met as a woman. sound good? :)<br />

self-summary is a struggle between being fully authentic while
being self-promoting. life is like that, so what can you do but
embrace it?<br />
<br />
so some grippy bits about me: i qualify as a full-on geek, and
therefore have a geeky approach to the things that i am into. my
tastes are quirky and eclectic. my interestes are both in matters
intellectual and puerile. i love music (live and recorded),
building stuff and going along with friends to try something
completely different. i like to explore the city by bike and and
enjoy spontaneous occasions. i enjoy partaking in general mischief
as a creative act: live it; love it; do it with heart.<br />
<br />
ok, so full disclosure: i am happily married and we both enjoy
seeing other people as part of our lifestyle. we are dedicated to
each other but enjoy ""extracurricular"" relationships. while we do
see women and couples together, i am on okc to meet like-minded
women who are either poly, poly friendly, or at least ambivalent
about this arrangement. since i am new to bringing this side of me
to online dating, i don't have specific expectations as to where
this will go. i hesitate to check the ""casual sex"" box because is
really not what i am all about. i am looking for someone with whom
i share a mutual ""click"" with and can quickly over that initial
awkwardness about talk about teh sexy.<br />
<br />
if you are still reading this, awesome. you got past the
potentially awkward bit, so onward to more stuff!","recently, i have been making a turnaround to spending less time in
bars and more involved in... well... activities. i have decided to
trade sitting hungover on the couch on sundays for making more of
the daytime. that means biking a lot, on the road and on the
trails. that's not to say i don't go out at night: i live seeing
live music and other spectacles, but i also enjoy just hanging
somewhere trading stories, perspectives and cheap laughs. i admit i
do like taking evenings in being chill, but i love when i get
pulled out by a friend who has some idea for a fun evening.","sussing things out, offering a peculiar perspective, pulling random
trivia out of my ass, playing the devil's advocate, philosophical
discourse and telling corny jokes. additionally, i am moderately
talented at convincing people that i am smart, which often leads to
smart people calling me on my shit.","my bright eyes, my expressive face, the fact that i can't seem to
pose ""normally"" in a photograph, and my general excitability.","i consider my musical tastes widely eclectic and i dare you to find
a pattern. i could make a giant list, but i will try to stick to
the heavy hitters: radiohead, porcupine tree, pinback, yeasayer,
talking heads, my morning jacket, el ten eleven, lcd soundsystem,
grizzly bear, gorrilaz, medeski martin &amp; wood, beck, minus the
bear, queens of the stone age, steely dan, tool, ween, modest
mouse, pink floyd, soul coughing, phish, pavement, ani difranco,
mono, devo, xx, cat power, jeff buckley, mike doughty<br />
<br />
my favorite author of all time is neal stevenson and loved
cryptonomicon, snow crash, quicksilver, anathem and the diamond
age. i read the baroque trilogy last year and it was epic. i am
currently reading foucault's pendulum by umberto eco but i might
give up on it as i keep picking up other books and reading them
instead. i just read shadow divers from robert kurson and it was
utterly fantastic. other books i have loved: a prayer for owen
meany- john irving, control of nature- john mcphee, cadillac
desert- marc reisner, a stranger in a strange land- robert a
heinlein, dune- frank herbert.<br />
<br />
movies are tough because, well, there are just so many, and i know
i will miss a bunch: vertigo, rear window, brazil, chinatown, the
big lebowski, the empire strikes back, harold and maude, the seven
samurai, office space, rear window, fight club. hitchcock is far
and beyond my favorite director.<br />
<br />
first on the tv list is going to be sci-fi: firefly, bsg, fringe,
farscape, stargate variants, star trek tos, cowboy bebop. *other
greats: deadwood, the wire, breaking bad, king of thrones *guilty
pleasures: family guy, the venture brothers, metalocalypse,
entourage, the deadliest catch, mystery science theater 3000","* music<br />
* honesty<br />
* being allowed to find anything funny<br />
* the company of people i love<br />

am spending my time being mindful about where i am at. this might
sound fluffy, but i have come to learn that this awareness is a
powerfully important part of maintaining a spirit that keeps
growing and learning, and not becoming lazy and getting along by
making assumptions.<br />
<br />
i like pondering the effects of technology on humanity. i think
that ""good"" and ""bad"" are troublesome judgements that occlude our
understanding of what things the future holds without
sensationalism or hysteria. i am fascinated looking at the writing
on walls like the redefinition of human communication by way of
unclassifiable expressionism on the intertubes, the advances
blurring the boundaries of cybernetics and human interfaces, and
the changing state of the resultant collective consciousness.<br />

comfortable, genuine, &amp; an entertaining story-teller. i'm a
social creature who enjoys learning what people are all about and
how they arrived at where they are today. i'm mainly on this site
for dating, but i've also made a handful of great friends too (yes,
i do believe coed friendships can work). i'm looking for someone
with interesting perspectives and positive attitudes towards
life.<br />
<br />
i've gone on many dates since moving to ca two years ago and have
notice a reoccurring pattern with my dates:<br />
<br />
- they are often surprised how comfortable i am at approaching
&amp; talking to women about any subject. this is mainly because of
my upbringing but more on that later...<br />
<br />
- i prefer to be tactfully honest and upfront - ""real"" so to speak.
this is often appreciated but surprising apparently.<br />
<br />
- even if we get along over email or the phone, that may not mean
anything until we actually meet. this is one reason why i prefer to
meet sooner rather than later.<br />
<br />
- i'm more generous and romantic than the average joe. however, i
only reserve this behavior for special people/occasions.<br />
<br />
- i haven't had many bad dates, but those that were involved women
who weren't open to friendship or upfront.<br />
<br />
about my date:<br />
<br />
i find that the more i date, the shorter my checklist of
""requirements"" becomes. every woman has her own strengths &amp;
charm, but ultimately i am simply looking for someone to share
great chemistry and experiences.<br />
<br />
what i am doing:<br />
<br />
i'm an advocate of working hard to play hard. you can often find me
trying new restaurants, going to art shows/festivals, playing pool
with friends or challenging strangers, or going for a jog in the
east bay.<br />

random things i dislike:<br />
<br />
eggplant - something about the texture; wind chill; snowboard
whiplash; bugs the size of my fist - pretty disturbing; trying to
get the last drops of a drink and having the ice fly into my
face.<br />

talking about being active - i love skiing , hiking and outdoors
activities. it doesn't mean that it's all what i do on the
weekends, but chances are that i'll be camping and hiking in
yosemite, biking somewhere close to city, or skiing at tahoe in a
winter on a weekend. if you love to do same stuff, contact me right

i obviously like some kind of extreme situations sometimes - have
done skydiving twice and will do it again. also my last camping
trip at yosemite was quite an experience - knowing that bear is
outside of a tent doesn't really help to fall asleep, but it's an
interesting way how mother nature can show you that you better be
careful sometime.<br />
<br />
oh, one more thing to mention here - i love to cook. only one
problem is that not cook just for myself. i found it quite boring
to prepare meal just for myself, so usually i cook when i have

years ago. people would probably describe my best qualities as my

the second-nicest thing was ""you have a unique combination of
intelligence and humility"" (although i guess none of this sounds
too humble).<br />

i have a new york, smart-ass, sarcastic side to me, but i tend to
use it for humor and not to put people down. think of a slightly
less snarky jon stewart. politically, i'm very liberal, although i
tend to get kind of miffed when people don't hold up their end of
the social compact.<br />

i'm comfortable hanging out at home, but i also like to socialize,
to explore san francisco's cultural attractions, and to play
outdoors. if i'm home, i might be reading, watching a movie or, if
i'm good, working out. if i'm out socializing, i'm likelier to be
in a restaurant or a coffee shop than in a bar. if i'm getting all
cultural, i might be at a museum or the symphony or the theater. if
i'm outdoors, i'm probably in the park or maybe doing a day hike or
a weekend trip somewhere within driving distance. i love the water

beautiful. i love a city where you can live with so much culture,
so many different kinds of people, and still see the sky!<br />
<br />
there's a lot of travel in my past: asia, africa, europe, central
america, scandinavia. i lived in japan as a freelance journalist
for 18 months. i raised money and served as ceo of a online gaming
company for a few years. whew!<br />

work at a mobile phone entertainment company. i like to cook and
host dinner parties. i like to take in new experiences!","i'm exploring the city, dancing, making good money, putting my

stands out in san francisco.","food - i eat nearly everything except beets and shelled peas. i
cook a decent roast chicken, then i'll turn the carcass into stock
and i've made decent matzo ball soup from that. i love shellfish
and shucking oysters. cooking is a fantastic way to feed myself;
eating out is fun but i get tired of rich restaurant food. i can
cook healthy or rich at home. eating out i generally like to
experiment and try new foods.<br />
<br />
music-wise, i love old blues like willie mctell and son house, and
piano jazz like duke ellington, mccoy tyner, bud powell and
thelonious monk. i love new music like remix glitch dubstep &amp;
cumbia. girl talk is fabulous. wendy carlos, sagan, soft pink

is an amazing dj who made me dance until i couldn't feel my happy
feet. marina and the diamonds is a guilty pleasure. aphex twin,
freescha, the gasman, hrvatski. magnetic field's 69 love songs is
good songsmithing and it makes me laugh. i have spent a lot of time
with jane's addiction, siouxsie &amp; the banshees, the grateful
dead, fishbone and jimi hendrix. i'm pretty open to most kinds of
music!<br />

my favorite films are zoolander, apocalypse now, galaxy quest, holy
mountain. i went through a phase of watching most all of peter
greenaway's films. i enjoy most of the will farrell i see

obsessively planning or fretting.","traveling to visit friends or family. taking in a movie, stand up

42,"curvy","","socially","never","","hey there. thanks for stopping by to check out my profile. so,
hmmm...here's where i have to talk about myself huh? not an easy
task to summarize yourself in a paragraph or two but i'll do my
best. i consider myself to be a down-to-earth, honest,
compassionate, balanced, playful and spiritual woman who loves life
and loves to laugh. i'm ambitious, intuitive, adventurous and
passionate about achieving my goals, and following my heart at all
cost. i really do believe that all things are possible in this life
and that it is only our beliefs that get in our way. i love to try
new things and stretch my own boundaries. i'm just as comfortable
roughing it while camping as i am with a night out on the town. i
live simply and love the small, beautiful details of this
life....smiles, good times spent with good friends, dogs, peanut
butter, a warm night, a hot bath, silence, sleeping under the
stars, the smell of rain, music in all forms, the warmth of
sunlight.... i can be quite serious at times but also have a
seriously silly (sometimes a downright smartass) side to me. i
definitely like to play and have fun. i have always been a seeker
of truth and absolutely love learning. i'm adventurous and am
thrilled to try new things, travel to new places and discover other
cultures and the stories of other people. i'm comfortable with all
types of people. diversity is beautiful and there is something to
learn, and something to give, to everyone we meet. i have a variety
of interests, including reading, singing, making music, going to
concerts, writing, dancing, firewalking, the study of metaphysics,
healing, massage, skydiving, trying new things, traveling, etc. but
my greatest addiction is music. my favorite music is pretty much
anything with good groove...funk, jazz, soul/neo-soul, etc. music
is oxygen for the soul. truly.<br />
<br />
ideally, i'm looking for ""my lobster""....someone who is my best
friend, the person i love spending time with most, someone who
makes me laugh, makes me think, encourages my growth and enhances
my talents. someone who is genuine, authentically himself,
comfortable and confident. someone who is spiritually motivated,
whatever his path may be that brings him closer to his creator.
someone who is down for the adventure and can spontaneously and
boldly pick up and go where his path leads him. someone who values
and honors the things in life that truly matter.....love, family,
friends, assisting our fellow human beings, etc. and above all
else, i'm looking for that undeniable, indescribable
chemistry.<br />
<br />
i'm also down to meet great people and hopefully make some good new
friends as well. so if that's all it becomes, that's totally cool
with me. good friends are just as valuable as a great lover. so, if
any of this resonates with you, then hit me up and let's see where
it goes.","living the adventure, exploring life with my dreams in my eyes and
the wind at my back. i just recently moved back to the bay area
after being in colorado for a few years. and i have to say....damn!
is it good to be back! i moved back because i'm an adoptee and just
located my biological family here in the bay just 3 months ago, so
what am i doing with my life? spending as much time as i can
getting to know this new family of mine...my tribe. it's been the
greatest blessing of my life.","treating people with kindness. finding reasons to laugh. trying new
things. singing. kissing. seeing the good in people. being silly.

positive. finding the humor in just about anything. massages. being

that they notice my eyes.","books: mostly non-fiction about spiritual (not religious) subjects,
metaphysics<br />
<br />
food: i really love it all but my absolute favorite food is sushi.
i truly believe i could eat sushi at every meal of the day and be
just fine with it. but i do love most any other type of food, the
more exotic the better. thai, indian, greek, italian,
jamaican.....i'll pretty much try anything.<br />
<br />
music: oh...this is where the list could get reeeeaalllly long! i'm
an addict when it comes to soul music. anything with a seriously
funky pocket gets me and holds me in the palm of its hand. a few of
my favorite artists/bands are: ledisi, chaka khan, dwele, prince,
jill scott, maxwell, marvin gaye, fela kuti, d'angelo, james brown,

work. i think i will be at peace with my work and my development
when i have my own place and it is flourishing.<br />
<br />
i would always welcome an opportunity to live and work abroad, and

work is so active, but i used to love running and swimming too. i
could definitely be talked into a ski trip as long as there is a

me laugh and who loves what they have in their own life.","i am a baker and pastry cook. the plan is to keep working at places
that will give me the best skills possible to eventually use in my
own place. i moved out here 3 years ago when i decided to begin
learning more about cooking so as to be better at writing about
food/cooks/restaurants as i had been doing. i quickly realized that
i would much rather be a cook than write about cooking. i did
really well quickly and got to work at tartine, chez panisse, cafe
fanny and some other east bay bakeries. i am kind of planning the
next steps for my growth as i have been getting pretty solid on the
baking aspects of running a bakery. i will need to go back to
school, but what school and what classes/degrees is to be
determined throughout my next year of baking work. i figure it
would be excellent to get some experience in europe, so i have been
trying to move forward with researching the u.k. visa requirements.
it would take a while to set up, but would ultimately be worth it
to work at this bakery called ottolenghi. wish me luck!","baking beautiful pastries and teaching others how to do so,

them and prove they can do a great or better job. the person that i
would like to meet is craving for team work and even tough they do
well on their own, they know it gets better when traveling life

like<br />
soccer, baseball, and basketball. i love to be in tahoe during
the<br />
winter. something about the snow makes me happy but i also love
the<br />
beach which is why i live 7 houses from it. i can be described
a<br />
hundred ways depending on the source. my mom thinks im
perfect<br />
(shocker) but people on the other side of the field may think
i'm<br />
an a-hole. i will take a guy down but after the game i am<br />
quick to buy them a beer. my friends think i am funny but the
guy<br />
that i laughed at after he accidentally walked into a stop
sign<br />
doesn't. i am known for never flaking and being genuine and
caring.<br />
i feel i have achieved a good balance in life. i can't be
labled<br />
under 1 stereotype. i am a responsible home owner that drives
a<br />
safe awd car that gets good gas mileage and is just ok to look
at.<br />
i never miss work because of being sick and i have never missed
a<br />
payment on anything. i don't mind musicals and drink wine
often.<br />
sounds boring yea? or i can be described as a major sports guy
that<br />
does everything aggressive and 100%. i ride a 1000cc sport bike

love to fly down the face of any snowboarding hill! concerts
are<br />
fun and comedy shows no matter how bad are entertaining to me.
i<br />
can go out drinking on any night of the week and will never say
no<br />
to a great time. i love to go camping or really do anything
with<br />
friends. i thrive being out in a crowd socializing and meeting
new<br />
people but i also really enjoy quiet intimate time with the
woman<br />
in my life. am i sounding any better? =) id like to think i am
a<br />
fun/ funny happy go lucky guy that likes to inflict a good
time<br />
upon all that encounter me! i am usually making sure that
everyone<br />
is taken care of and having a spectacular time. i am reliable
and<br />
stable. if you are sick i'd take care of you and if you were
down<br />
i'd make you smile. i am confident and secure of who i am as
a<br />
person and am looking for a similar quality in the people i
date.<br />
arrogant i am not, however... unless we are talking about how
i<br />
dominate at useless things like board games, paddle ball and<br />
ro-sham-poe than i may let you know how amazing i am! i kid i
kid<br />
but i am competitive. if you win you will always have to
question<br />
whether i let you ;) most of my aggressiveness is saved for
my<br />
sporting events. i am very often inappropriate (if you
couldn't<br />
tell already) and politically correct people may have some
issues<br />

lead<br />
late in a game. i like to dance when i have the opportunity but
you<br />
won't catch me line dancing (saddle rack) if my life depended
on<br />
it. i love live music and 49er/giants games. take a chance and
let<br />
me know you are interested. isn't that why we are here? i'll
be<br />

me to play in 7 different sports leagues throughout the week.

skill. examples are paddle ball at the beach, rock paper scissors
to see who has to go to the store, almost all team sports, and my
job. at least i think im good at those things. i have been wrong
before. if you beat me at something you will have to question
whether i let you... or you cheated! haha ;)","they notice i'm short, fat, have terrible b.o. and absolutely have

job. i really enjoy living in sf and have enjoyed visiting other
parts of the bay area.<br />
<br />
music is very important to me, you'll rarely see me in silence. i
have a fairly large music collection spanning many genres and eras.
i grew up listening to the beatles, 90s rock and classical but have
lately branched out into more electronic music. i am not an expert
on classical composer's catalogues, but i'd say that by volume,
beethoven is my favourite composer.<br />
<br />
when i was younger, i was involved in the air cadets in canada.
through the program, i was able to get my pilot's license. flying
is one of the most fun and rewarding things i've ever done, and is
something that i intend to resume once i finally have a bit of
spare time.<br />
<br />
i also love working on and driving cars. i have been helping build
a couple racing cars with my friends. we are building a vw bug and
a bmw 325i (e30) both for endurance racing. for the bug, i designed
a dual control system so that you can drive from either side of the
car. it's really neat! i would also like to build a track car at
some point as i love precision driving but don't want to risk a
nice car.","","","i am canadian, but don't say eh, oot or aboot.","i love watching good movies. my favourite movies are surreal, war,

absolutely, all-time, favourite show is the new top gear uk. i like
other shows as well, mainly dramas and a couple comedy shows. i
also love well done documentaries on interesting topics.<br />
<br />
music is extremely important to me. i grew up in a very musical
home and pretty much listen to music all the time. i grew up with
the beatles, stones and classical. for the last few years, i've
been expanding my tastes. these days i listen to a mixture of
almost everything other than country and mainstream pop.<br />

i like a mixture of foods, but it comes down to liking meat, roots,
brocolli and fruit, neutral on other veggies, disliking fish and
other seafood.","1) good sound system. i love music and i love my sound system. it

31,"fit","mostly anything","socially","never","graduated from masters program","so here's the thing: although i'd love to find and make a real
connection with someone, dating itself can become a full-time job.
and when you're busy with other things -- such as an active,
productive, offline life -- it can start to feel like a rat-race
and stop being fun. and that's no good. in the meantime, i continue
to have needs and desires of my own, along with the ample ability
(and the strong, strong desire) to satisfy the needs and wants of a
like-minded woman.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for a smart, kind, confident woman who also has a
naughty side. the kind of woman that no one would suspect would be
bad, but underneath it all, she has needs of her own, and she needs
to satisfy them, ravenously. looks matter a great deal, obviously,
but i find hidden naughtiness to be an incredible turn-on, perhaps
because i prefer to keep my own naughtiness firmly in check, only
unleashing it around a select few.<br />
<br />
this is all something of an experiment. what follows is completely
honest and legit, but it's just one, very private side of my
personality. the experiment, then, is to see what happens when i
stop being private and start being direct (like ""the real world""!).
although i'm being very up-front about things, i hope you can
detect my playful tone. i also hope you can detect that i'm more
than just your normal sleazy guy looking to get laid -- i'm
educated, accomplished, happy, and i have a wide range of non-sex
related, non-online related interests and pursuits. i'm also quite
modest, too :)<br />
<br />
why the dearth of pictures, you ask? because the bay area's a small
place, and i know people on this site. i have no qualms whatsoever
about being here. but i'm not particularly interested in friends,
family, and co-workers seeing this private side of my personality
-- that's all. i have absolutely nothing to hide, and if we hit it
off and you're genuinely interested (and not just idly curious),
i'd be more than happy to send you additional pictures.<br />
<br />
i know that if a woman was in a similar situation and created a
similar profile, she would be inundated with messages. if a guy
does the same, what happens? we'll see ...","running social experiments on dating websites, clearly.","writing, empathizing, critical thinking, cooking, being kind.<br />
<br />
also, cuddling, kissing, licking, and nibbling.<br />
<br />
most importantly, teasing you and pleasing you.","depends on whether i'm wearing any clothes, i suppose, and how i
might be greeting the person in question ...<br />
<br />
i'm also well-aware that my picture is not very illuminating, and
that you'd probably love to see my face. i'd love to show you, too.
but i hope you can appreciate my desire for just a little anonymity
in this public forum. if you're interested and we hit it off, i'm
happy to send you a proper photo.","","","how i can make a positive difference in the world and feel
satisfied in the process.<br />
<br />
ways to pleasure and satisfy those who give me the greatest
pleasure and satisfaction","there's no such thing as ""typical,"" right? i thought everyone knew
that by now.<br />
<br />
i will say that i'm much more mellow than i am wild, and i find
similar traits very attractive in a woman.","i think you're reading it right now!<br />
<br />
also, i've been told that i'm ""quite filling"" ...<br />
<br />
(yes, in that way ;)","because what's the harm, really? i'm not a promiscuous guy, and i
really would love to find and make a deep connection with someone.
but i also have other needs and desires, and i'm trying to be
upfront and honest about them. among other things, i'm looking for
safe, responsible, not-so-wholesome, mutual fun.<br />
<br />
but here's the thing: i suspect that you just might feel exactly
the same way, or at least be a bit intrigued, even if you don't
admit it openly in your profile. i get that -- hell, i generally
don't reveal this side of my personality, which is why this is
something of an experiment for me. so if any of this resonates with
you -- or turns you on -- feel free to say hi :)<br />
<br />
as for what i find attractive: truthfully, i find smart, kind,
confident women to be extremely sexy. such a woman is not only who
i'd love to find in terms of a long-term relationship, but also in
terms of someone with whom to have tons of fun.<br />
<br />
looks, like i said, do matter a great deal. but i really don't have
any hard and fast rules that define what i'm attracted to. you
should be active and take care of your body. i love sexy legs and a
great ass -- but also a lovely chest and nice hair. i've always
been a sucker for necks and shoulders. but a killer smile and
piercing eyes will always win me over.<br />
<br />
in short, i love everything about a woman, and giving pleasure is
something i deeply crave. although it might sound like a cliche, my
biggest turn-on is, honestly, turning you on.","",72,-1,"","2012-07-01-03-02","san francisco, california","","straight","likes dogs and likes cats","judaism but not too serious about it","m","","no","english","single"

where all i listen to was npr, but sometimes news was just too

fun music can be stimulating to the brain as well. again, with the
internet, it's so easy to look up the actual pieces that make up
the mash-ups. down the rabbit hole i went, and i came out liking a
bunch of old stuff - queen, fleetwood mac, frankie goes to
hollywood, and chic, a bunch of new stuff - martin solveig, robin,
silversun pickups and learned not to be prejudice against britney

great conversation (i'm an npr listener)<br />
road trips, camping (i have a camper), motorcycle rides (access to

<br />
let me start off by saying a bit of who i am and what makes me
tick.<br />
<br />
i am a simple person with complex dreams, aspirations and goals. i
am driven by my belief that happiness is the ultimate goal in life
regardless of wealth, status or recognition.i enjoy life and all
that it has to give and cherish the company of the people that i
surround myself with.my final goal in life is to be able to look
back on it and honestly say ""i lived a happy life.""<br />
<br />
but dont mistake my love for life as naivety. i hold my senses of
observation in high regard. i enjoy being able to learn new things
about others and what makes them tick.<br />
<br />
i would consider myself not only entertaining, witty and
nonchalant, but also intelligent, charismatic, snarky and a bit of
a smart ass.<br />
<br />
i consider myself an extrovert who enjoys being around people as
opposed to being separated from society. i would rather sit down
with a stranger and get to know them then to sit down and read a
book. i love being able to sit down with a group of friends and
just talk the night away, and who would blame us if there were a
few drinks in there as well.<br />
<br />
i got my bachelor's in game design and level art. that is just
fancy talk for saying that i am a 3d artist. i can create things
either for movies (like wall-e or 9) as well as video games (yes,
that makes me a bit of a nerd).<br />
<br />
that's all i can come up with for now. if you have any questions
for me, feel free to ask.","","life.","the fact that i love life and prefer to do everything i can to

you have a nice smile, or that you're interesting, because yes,

just don't think i can capture the essence of me, just not

i will say; however, that several of my friends and an ex of mine
have called me a ""food, espresso, wine"" snob. i believe it's due to
same reason someone said i was ""precise"". mostly not that i like
the nicest things in this world, but because i expect a level of
precision, i am very much my myers briggs type when you get to know
me (intj). you just have to get past the illusion of social
farced.<br />

something else that i have been called before is, ""dispassionately
compassionate."" what this means i am not sure but most people seem
to agree with it. my only guess is that i am rather logical, but
have a warm heart when it comes to people that come in to my life,
even if it is only for a short time i still care about the people
around me. i also am a firm believer in """"act only according to
that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should
become a universal law.""<br />

meet new people and network with similar souls.<br />
would like to meet a woman for friendship and exploration of life -
and we can see how it goes..<br />
i am a sculptor,painter, and jewelry artist<br />
i have my own gallery for the past 30 years- 5 of those years are
currently on polk st. near washington considered nob hill. stop in,
check my art out, check me out anonymously,whatever or say hi and
introduce yourself ,modernlifedesigns(dot)com is my website. there
are a few photos of me from a few years ago,anyway back to the
subject at hand,<br />
i am a simple guy, kinda funny without trying, not much of a
drinker, so i don't hang out at bars, i rather be in my gallery
making art, that's really what i like to do- maybe to much-<br />
since there never seems to be enough time when you're running your
own business.<br />
i enjoy the creative process- tinkering around in my studio,
forgetting the noise of the ordinary world.<br />
i was married for 20 years, i have been a widower since 2004, time
heals all wounds they say, i do get a twinge now and again. i know
how to make a relationship work. the theme of love is something
that is important in the work that i create. yet there is also a
sensual and sexual quality there also, not overt but tasteful. i am
quite athletic- i really don't like to exercise and force myself to
go swimming<br />
weekly- and even do 16 laps of butterfly in my routine, i tell
myself its good for the posture, plus it makes the hour go faster.
i am mostly a vegetarian but do eat a little fish now and then , i
was macrobiotic for many years, andmaybe still am a bit, i could
cook you a dinner sometime. it is pretty clean and simple food .i
do make a great flatbread and learning to make crackers for the
crunch vs potato chips once to often. i do have a sweet tooth, i
love milk chocolate as a favorite along with a pastry and latte,
though i have to keep that to a minimum. the body is a temple a
sacred vessel. what you do and put into it makes a difference for
health and clear thinking. i should add that i eat some form of
kale almost everyday. i am not a total bore, i do go out to eat
once in a while, enjoy italian food and a sunday omelet brunch. i
do like to be in the forest among the big redwoods, it grounds me
since i am a little in the clouds. since i mentioned clouds, and my
head, as an artist, i have done research into the spiritual
sciences, seeking that great creative font, where all things come
from. the well is indeed deep, which can be awe inspiring yet very
overwhelming for a simple soul. so from this perspective, all life
is sacred, the earth is sacred, and until humanity respects that
concept, we will continue down the road of despair and unhappiness.
i myself have great hope in the long term, for this is what my art
is truly about, the great hope and beauty that is attainable in all
of us. it maybe far off in the distant future-- we are in for a
wild ride. that is why a guy just wants to have a some fun. let's
go hear some live music. it would be nice to meet someone that is
creative and fun with a loving kind spirit, so we can inspire each
other, to new levels in all the creative realms.<br />

again whoever said that was in love :-). regardless, i am
easygoing, attentive, honest and loyal. i'm also a good listener
and a fair arbitrator- and when necessary can be tough as
nails.<br />
<br />
i think i have lived a very interesting life (so far). it sure
seems that way to me. never been much of a dull moment, with one
unexpected or unconventional experience after another. it's not
always that i've sought such things, but once my path found a
trajectory, events and synchronicities seemed to take on a life of
their own. i have always been an inveterate risk-taker. it's not
that i like danger (i'm actually rather quiet)- i'm just so damn
curious.<br />
<br />
i'm in a bit of a ""settling down"" phase these days- although what
lies around the next corner remains a mystery. i've been a dad
(still am), been married (more than once), had a successful career
(still do), traveled a good bit (want to do more), and in general
have achieved more (and seen/experienced more) than i ever thought
i would or could. so, i am wondering... now what?","i've noticed that some people feel the need to state that they
""love their work but don't identify with it"". as if who they are
and what they do are completely separate. i'm not quite that way.
what i do is integrated into who i am, and vice versa. and it works
great. my life (and work) is about telling the truth... and about
service to humankind (and the planet)... about exploring problems
and solutions... about growth and integrity... and about evolving
the human potential.<br />
<br />
i'm a documentary filmmaker by trade, and as such have always been
curious about to the various forces at play in the world. i've had
many opportunities to explore interesting, sometimes challenging
and sometimes exotic people, subjects and locales.<br />
<br />
right now i'm reinventing my life a bit. exploring the edges,
looking for where to land. seeking warmth and companionship- a
partner and playmate. i've been spending some time off (big sur and
hawaii), reflecting and seeing old friends. for the last 18 years,
i've been very parent-oriented. now that my son is 18, i have some
room to explore.","making coffee (once i get up!)<br />

meet someone who has seen one of my films, or seen me in an
interview or on tv, or something... i prefer anonymity. i think
what most new friends see is my sincerity and insight... and a
general, comfortable ease while engaging in any topic or activity.","it's always changing... for plain ol escapist entertainment i like
big hollywood movies- spielberg and christopher nolan, harry
potter, etc. i do a lot of research on the internet, and am a fan
of many things alternative, as well as the bona fide. i like the
edge. so, specifically (in terms of non-fiction), i am into free
energy, remote viewing, crop circles, eschatology (studying the end
of history), personal growth of many kinds, tantra, gestalt,
indigenous spirituality, the amazon (as in jungle), ancient
monuments, hawaii...","my kids<br />

champion of love and justice, but that part's supposed to be a
secret.<br />

part cowgirl, part ninja and part gypsy. i work with dogs for a
living, own and ride horses, and work part time on a ranch out in
the middle of nowhere where i chase cows. i don't smoke or drink,
but i am a major sweetaholic.<br />
<br />
my passion is animal behavior. if you can't stand to talk about
animals (especially dogs) for at least half an hour straight, you
probably don't want to initiate any conversations with me. same
applies if you aren't interested in dissecting the troups of mecha
and magical girl genres, discussing why ff8 was the last great
squareenix title, or debating over which publisher is better:
marvel or dc (i'm a marvel girl, but if you like dc it's ok. i can
convert you).<br />
<br />
i also really like unicorns. really. it's almost unhealthy.","i currently work with dogs as a trainer and handler. my aspiration
is to continue to study animal behavior -- focusing on canines, but
not exclusively -- and possibly train animals for film.<br />
<br />
i'd like to bring back the types of animal films i grew up with
(homeward bound, lassie, benji, black beauty, etc.), which are
sadly being replaced by cgi. and i'd like to do it with rescue
animals.<br />

with it! i will talk about it for hours..complete with gory,
violent details.<br />
<br />
i'm one of those people who complains about having no free time,
and then as soon as i get some i have to fill it up with something
fast - there are just so many things that i want to do! (so if you
message me, and it takes me a while to respond, it's probably
because i've worked myself to exhaustion).","telling tales. i can spin a good yarn that will intrigue and
entrap, i can. i'm also good at getting along with animals,
teaching dogs (and some cats) silly tricks, and i can hold my own
on horseback. i can draw and write a little, but i'm constantly
trying to get better.<br />
<br />
i'm particularly good at drawing unicorns. if this were the '80s,
when unicorns were at their prime, i would probably already be rich
off of my illustrations. sadly, it looks like zombies reign this
decade, and i'm absolutely horrible at drawing zombies.","my hair. it's usually everywhere. almost like it has a life of its

<br />
the second is probably my big, black, scary looking dog, since he
is almost always with me. (he's friendly, honest)","my favorite books are far too many to list, but include (in no
particular order): war for the oaks by emma bull, american gods by
neil gaiman, the last unicorn by peter s. beagle, howl's moving
castle by diana wynne jones and the his dark materials trilogy by
philip pullman -- to name very few.<br />
<br />
favorite movies include the last unicorn, the indiana jones trilogy
(it's a trilogy!), v for vendetta, lady and the tramp, the lion
king, all dogs go to heaven, labyrinth, legend, batman begins,
princess mononoke, spirited away, howl's moving castle -- almost
anything ghibli, really.<br />
<br />
i don't watch a lot of tv. most of my favorite shows are either
throwbacks or anime, with a few guilty pleasures thrown in.
although i love, love, love l&amp;o: svu. i know it's horribly sick
and disgusting, but i can't help it. also, i'm currently obsessed
with game of thrones and so you think you can dance.<br />

my taste in music varies widely. my ipod has a little of everything

listen to it. artists whom i've been playing almost nonstop lately:
neko case, ray la montagne, nicki minaj, florence + the machine,
the carolina chocolate drops, leona lewis, miranda lambert, the
civil wars, and the yoshida brothers.<br />

human reason to do good.<br />

fairness is a big deal for me. i don't get angry very often, but
watching one person exploit another usually does the trick.<br />

when threatened by predators, i can inflate to three times my
normal size.","i'm doing the academic thing -- i'm driven to find out how the
world works, and i love being surrounded by interesting, quirky,
intellectual people.","i ask interesting questions.","","i don't own a television, and my reading tends to range pretty
widely (though these days it's mostly nonfiction). right now i'm
reading how we reason, the spirit level (a book with plots! about
economic inequality!), and the reactionary mind.<br />

i've been especially influenced by a few books. the ones that come
to mind are guns, germs and steel; gdel escher bach; the making of
the atomic bomb; and albion's seed.<br />

last year was amazing as i traveling to over 10 different counties
and finished my graduate degree. i will always be a student. one of
the trips i took was random, which started out in japan and ended
up though korea and philippines. the best part, no itinerary or
return ticket. i didn't have a place to go to when i got off the
airplane and that was part of the fun. complete freedom, no clock,
no agenda- truly amazing trip.<br />

i reason that i can't be put into a box is because i am a walking
dichotomy. i would rather play sport rather than watch them. i have
a motorcycle and enjoy chess. people tell me that i am nice- but i
am not a push over, and when it comes to family and friends i am
very protective. friends that i have i will know them for

money lending books to friends. i work in a kitchen, which means i
curse a lot, hang out with jocks who make fun of how nerdy i am,
and can drink many beers in a row. i now also work in the wine
industry which despite it being a slimy amoral world, obsessed with
a closed set of fundamentally useless knowledge and plagued with
elitism does in fact have some negative parts. i grew up in oakland
and as a result i am always conscious about things that may get
stolen. sometimes books put me into the same state that people get
into on cocaine, where i blow off my friends because i just want to
read one more chapter, and one more and one more, and this will go
on for hours. funny is the most important quality in friends. i am
always surprised by how much of an impression visual art makes on
me, agnes martin broke my heart a little bit. i used to go to
boxing classes many hours a week and it left me with a certain
jumpy anxiety that someone was going to hit me and make math way
harder for the rest of my life. i try and take photographs as much
as i can, right now i am really into portraits, which is some total
photo 1 shit, but whatever i didn't go to art school i'm figuring
out all this cliche stuff on my own. i don't really scar, but this

realized there's no way to tell i broke my nose and reset it in a

open relationship with a wonderful woman and am not trying to cheat
on her or anything like that. but we are open and i am retired,
very energetic and have a strong relationship libido. i am
convinced that women are out there who would like a friend and
sometime lover without all the strings if the guy wasn't cheating
and if they had access when they wanted. that doesn't mean i am
available at any old time, but it sure means that there are no
secrets. for instance you could call me, come over, ask me out, go
to a movie, have me over, or whatever. you can also meet the
wonderful woman i live with. in fact you could have dinner with us
and maybe have both of us for friends or more if that's what our
mutual vibe led us to.<br />
we have an open relationship but are not swingers. we like to dance
(swing, lindy hop, and salsa) but are not doing it all the time. we
both like to read (don't watch tv) but are into food and drink,
smoke but not tobacco. see what i mean about not fitting a
category? we are intense about good listening and being clear in
relationships, and also love to play games, tell jokes, sing, cook,
and all the fun human stuff. where a friendship would go is not as
important as who we are to each other, although being affectionate
and perhaps sensual would be enjoyable.<br />

others. any interest? let's chat?<br />

way to come to any conclusion through the internet if two perfect
strangers would have any sort of basis for a potentially
life-altering encounter. for the most part, i am quite empathic and
if you are too, we can have endless conversations without ever
saying a word. however, i do value communication, a lot actually.
especially the clear kind devoid of sarcasm, snarky comebacks, etc.
i am for the most part, an optimist. and for the other part, a
realist. so i'm looking for a relationship based on mutual growth.
i'm equally comfortable being a teacher and a student as i've had
practice being both for many years over. i like problem solving
rather than philosophically pondering the nether reaches of
obscurity. i'm not saying that everything needs to have an answer,
but i like my philosophical thinking to lead to discoveries (those
light-bulb moments) rather than to more unanswerable questions, if
you catch my drift.<br />
<br />
i generally like working on projects together, whether it be
building something, or cooking dinner together. i enjoy
collaboration. so it would be great to have activities with mutual
interest. i've worked with horses, have sailed, like camping, play
instruments, practiced various forms of art, etc, so try me. i'm
not afraid of getting my hands dirty. i enjoy going out and
socializing but also enjoy quiet time, and find that i need a good
balance of both. i don't smoke or use drugs. not really a drinker
of alcohol or coffee.<br />

in response to the question: what do you want to be when you grow
up? is, 'i want to be happy.' so i've taken joseph campbell's words
to heart and have 'followed my bliss.' i enjoy learning, traveling,
cooking, gardening, problem-solving. i believe in the importance of
giving back to the community and have worked hard so that i can
help others. sometimes, one can feel so much joy and appreciation
quietly peeling an apple, or finding a feather out in the fields. i
have pets (they're all rescue and don't include a dog/cat, even
though i like them too). the things that make me happy are the
simple things in life, being out in nature, sleeping when you're
tired, dancing when you're inspired, being silly and full of
laughter. i like being creative, visiting new places, playing
music, cooking without a recipe, walking and noticing the fine

hike somewhere is a welcome respite. i'm for the most part very
laid back, would enjoy a night of laughing and jokes over serious
talk. i like conversation a lot. activities are fun too. i'm also
pretty self-deprecatory. sometimes people think i am fishing for
compliments. that is almost always never the case.<br />

before i came to stanford i was living in ecuador for two years,
teaching and bumming around, traveling to peru the beach and cuba.
before that i lived in new mexico in an isolated indian community
for five years, teaching and roaming the desert. that was a pretty
incredible experience, but many of my friends and family were a
little worried about my decision making skills. it was pretty
isolated.<br />
<br />
in my free time i try to make it to the gym a few days a week, play
soccer and spend time with friends. i like to spend my spring
breaks camping somewhere (joshua tree being a favorite) and my
weekends having a drink or watching a movie.","phd program studying educational inequality + some statistics.","finding delicious looking recipes and emailing them to people who

recently celebrated my 34th birthday. my friend and i were tasked
with a scavenger hunt all over le de la cit in paris in search of
comt cheese, saucisson, and bien sr une baguette. our other
friend would supply the wine and champagne. we met at the edge of
the island, overlooking the seine. the sun began to set as we dined
on meats, cheese, and wine on this most glorious autumn day in
paris. it was truly memorable birthday, but most of all, it was
better than celebrating at a mexican restaurant, wearing a giant
sombrero.<br />
<br />
hopefully, that story gives you a gleam into my personality. i love
travelling, food, wine, and experiencing different cultures. i
don't particularly enjoy tourist attractions. for me, travelling is
my way to see the world through a different pair of eyes and
realize there's more to life than my little corner of the planet.
my other great passion is music. i've devoted an entire room in my
house to be a music studio and to house my vinyl record
collection.<br />
<br />
career-wise, i reached a good amount of success at an early age,
but i feel i sacrified some of my personal life during that time.
now, i'd love to meet someone special and be in a relationship and
eventually start a family. my first niece was just born a few
months ago, and it's an amazing feeling when i hold her and look
into her adorable face and can see some semblance of myself.<br />

hey there!<br />
<br />
i try to see the best in people. i believe in being inclusive.
being impeccable with your word to yourself and others goes a long
way in life. i think you try and do your best each day, some days
thats more than others. live as if you'll die tomorow but love as
if you'll live forever. do unto others as you would have them do
unto you. dr. suess gave some great advise over the years. be who
you are and say what you feel because those who matter won't mind
and those who mind don't matter. you've got to put it out there.
all good words to live by.<br />

i<br />
<br />
-moved to oakland almost 2 years ago from tallahassee fl<br />
-have a welsh corgi named science<br />
-tend to make more art than i consume<br />
-don't ever go dancing 'cause 99% of the time i think the music
is<br />
terrible but, that's not to say i won't dance to my favorite
bands<br />
-love cooking except when it's just for myself<br />
-really would like more people to hang out with. it's way harder
to<br />
make friends in your late 20s outside of a college town<br />
<br />
there's more but i'll save that for later.","-kicking ass at my career<br />
-trying my best to make friends in what little free time i do have

sense)<br />
-working on getting ready for summer beach party blast 2012. i also
recently cut my hair a bit. so really, almost all the pics i have
on here are pretty outdated.","-playing any instrument i dont have to blow in to<br />
-cooking vegan and vegetarian food despite not having that
diet<br />
-paying attention to things people like and buying them great gifts","i gonna guess it's either the ridiculous sleeve tattoo, my big ears
or my flowing locks of man hair.","i could go into serious detail but i'll save that for if we end up
talking / hanging out / sharing a telepathic mind link. so here's
the general idea:<br />
<br />
-mostly indie comics<br />

etc...)<br />
<br />
-horror, sci-fi, experimental, art house<br />
(cronenberg, jodorowsky, lynch, gondry, guest etc...)<br />
<br />
-almost everything jj abrams touches, game of thrones, archer,
adventure time<br />
<br />
-metal, electronic music, post rock, and the occasional booty
jam<br />
(high on fire, mum, gy!be, fannypack etc...)<br />
<br />
-everything except for raw celery and mangos","i'm going to assume the basics are covered. that aside,<br />
<br />
-my dog<br />
-a guitar<br />
-a fully stocked kitchen<br />
-sketch book and a pen that will last for eternity<br />
-another person i got along with<br />

-food i'm going to make.<br />

way to get to know who i am is to message me and chat with me :) i
will say that i feel i have been put on this earth to help and
create positive energy to either people in need or just to make
amazing experiences with great people. i try to stay positive and
make every moment count. i am outgoing, goofy and usually
unpredictable.. haha not in a bad way. ok.. don't be afraid to send
me a message. :)","currently working full time and living in san mateo. i enjoy what i
do. i am a personal stylist at nordstrom and am a private personal
trainer/fitness instructor. i do the training on the side because i
just enjoy that better than working at a gym for the time being. i
also just love helping people reach a goal that may be too hard for
them to get to on their own, or they just need the extra push. i go
out here and there and feel i have a pretty good balance between
relaxed and crazy. i love going out to dinner. visiting new places,
restaurants, and just sitting and having good conversation.","making people laugh.","crazy sense of humor.<br />

fitness books. i used to read all the stephen king books i could
get my hands on. i love description. i did read every goosebumps
books ever written back in hs hahaha<br />
<br />
movies, i love comedy of course, i will watch and actually enjoy a
chick movie here and there. love suspense. i think that's just one
of the things i love to do, watch movies. glass of wine and a good
flick. sounds like a great night to me.<br />
<br />
shows.. i have gone to a decent amount of shows, being from a small
town you don't get to many big names coming to your area. haha. i
have seen muse twice, very good! tool, nin, steve miller band
(which was fun) i have gone to numerous music events back in the
day for work. i love all types of music, so i would be willing to
try any new show that comes along.<br />
<br />
i just flat out love music. i know this is feeling like a term
paper here. ""a few music group that i enjoy are...."" hahaha. no,
but i played a few instruments when i was younger. sax, piano, a
little drums. i feel i can hold a tune. i pretty much will try most
all music for a while.. i can't only take so much screamer music at
once before i wanna jump off a cliff, but its ok. rap is a mixed
bag for me. i like it sometimes, but it may be too much for me too.
i just don't like the lyrics sometimes and it gets annoying that
there are grown men grunting in the background and saying ""what"" or
""huh"" all the time. why are they even there?? haha. moral support?
i like 90s rock, 80s music, even blue grass. i could go on forever,
so i will stop there.<br />
<br />
food needs its own website. i love food! i love almost all types.
i'll be quick about thing. if i had to choose a few things that i
could have everyday. sushi, thai, ice cream, and we will say....
cheese! i love cheese. anything with cheese on it. totally not an
emotional eater... can you tell? haha. no.. i am willing to try

scratching my head, then proceed with the soon-to-be incongruous
and barely intelligible assemblance of thoughts and
descriptions.<br />
yup, that would be me.<br />
<br />
im quite sure this one will end up in the circular file for a
rewrite, but, um...here we go<br />
<br />
gotta say, i really don't much like talking about myself. east
coast, then transbay transplant that's planted here now for 30
years or so. tried to leave a couple times, but i missed being
pushed from behind by miniscule ancient chinese ladies barking in
cantonese while waiting in line in the bank. i mean, who wouldn't
miss that?<br />
and besides, i was busy daydreaming while my turn awaited.<br />
<br />
life has definitely been a myriad of experiences. never thought i'd
be who i am, or where i am. i always thought i'd be a famous
artist, musician, or photojournalist. now i realize its not the
fame. ego played a cruel game in order to motivate interests that
would later become true appreciation. i thrive on being with the
creative and humorous.<br />
<br />
spend a little time wondering where the hell we're headed, watching
things spin out of control, i suppose it's that way for everyone
growing. i don't want to spend all my time on the phone.<br />
sure, iphones are phat an all dat, but so is a good game of
baseball or basketball, and it's difficult to hold the phone and
play. (i have, however been known to light up a cigarette with
tennis racquet in hand)<br />
<br />
i've definitely spent too much time alone of late, so i guess it's
time to get moving again. meeting new people. making new friends.
opening up fresh experiences.<br />
<br />
more later, im sure this profile stuff is a work in progress. who
knows, maybe i'll win the lottery (i doubt it without a ticket),
and end up in bahia, running an internet business on the beach,
from a laptop, and, of course...updating my profile.","i wonder? what im doing with my life....living it on its terms i
hope.<br />
navigating the changing landscape of work. starting multiple
projects, some of which i'll never finish. hanging out with like
minded, and diametrically opposed people. yeah, we're all in this
together.<br />
take it all in, live, love, show compassion, explore the inner,
absorb the outer.","wow, scary. am i good at anything? writing, listening, caring /
not-caring, not knowing what time it is, singing, saying the wrong
thing.<br />
(even if was right, it may not have been)","im a freak. dorky?....maybe funny, and definitely funny

i can talk me some politics and philosophy if you like. but don't

addition to getting absorbed in a (mostly) fun grad program, i
loved the idea of escaping to the outdoors by running/ biking up
the hill from campus and continue that habit to a lesser degree
today.<br />
my best friend's brother went into architecture- with that small
inspiration, i decided to give it a go and have been in the field
ever since, liking the practical side as much or more so than the
theoretical. i like using a hammer.<br />
i was married in 2001 to my friend of many years and we went on to
have two girls who are now 8 and 11. the girls are very much at the
center of my life. the relationship shifted away from romantic, tho
we remain friends and co parents. we have not divorced but will not
be going back. she is now living w/loving another mom and her 2
kids, so lots of adjustments for all concerned.<br />
at this point, having had some time for things to settle, i feel
like i'm ready to create something new.","i like designing, and am mostly busy with modest remodeling
projects, sometimes exhibit design. a lot of my time and energy
goes in the direction of the 2 girls, soccer, homework, music, etc.
meanwhile, i do want to create a good, no great, new adult
relationship. in spare time, i like running, hiking, being in the
outdoors, being at home, oh and love to commute/ ride around on my
bike more and more.","drawing, tinkering, listening; not too bad at being a dad","probably light on the hair (meaning little of not light bouncing
off), glasses, brown eyes?","recently finished ""out stealing horses"" and loved it.<br />
no tv currently, but have seen and enjoyed curb, dexter, mad men,
hornblower, the wire, glee.<br />
just saw west side story, wow. breaking bad.<br />
mexican food probably my go to thing, anything with a little to a
lot of spice.<br />
fan of eds redeeming qualities, pixies, cat power, radiohead, amy
winehouse (rip), mercedes sosa to name a few... a bit out of touch

<br />
nature is my favorite playground, preferably running, cycling or
backpacking, but i'm equally happy exploring cities, dancing when
the music is funky, eating out &amp; cooking at home, practicing
yoga, &amp; catching live music when the muse calls. i like soul
music &amp; soul food, bicycles &amp; good espresso.<br />
<br />
i'm a traveler &amp; seeker: this past summer i volunteered as a
tutor in a small buddhist monastery deep in the himalaya for young
'mini-monks' and then trekked 21 days across ladakh. in my 20s i
served 2 years as a peace corps volunteer in west africa.<br />
<br />
i feel incredibly lucky &amp; grateful to live here. and at this
point in my life, i'm 100% focused on finding a sweet, adventurous
&amp; open-hearted partner who is ready to set down roots.","creating great urban places is a passion &amp; outgrowth of a
life-long commitment to the environment. my career has focused on
the tangible, first as a lawyer, then developer and most recently
in public policy. in may i finished a 4-year run in the mayor's
office; in late june i started a new business partnership. at heart
i'd say that i'm part entrepreneur and part artist, learning to
marry the practical and the visionary.<br />
<br />
i relish playing, especially in balance with work. i treasure
spending time with my diverse family of friends, dancing often
(burning man is an annual ritual for this reason), getting outdoors
&amp; challenging myself with new activities outside my comfort
zone... last year it was aerial gymnastics, this year i think its
climbing.<br />

better, they discover my sense of humor and love of the absurd.","a voracious reader of news, especially online political journals, i
don't read as many novels (the road by cormac mccarthy was my last)
as non-fiction. i also have an ever-expanding collection of poetry;
mary oliver &amp; david whyte top my list. and i have to admit that
i have a geeky obsession with fantasy, having recently devoured all
five books in the game of thrones series.<br />
<br />
i don't own a tv, but have fallen into temporary obsessions with
the wire, mad men and now, of course, game of thrones. and i'll
admit that i love south park on you tube.<br />
<br />
i'm passionate about music and expanding my love of it. my sweet
spot is probably alt-folk-indie stuff, especially gillian welch,
wilco and m ward, but i also love dancing to break-beats (pink
mammoth, green gorilla, brasstax), afrobeat, neo-soul (d'angelo
&amp; anthony hamilton in particular) old-school 70s funk and soul
(curtis, sly &amp; al), and chamber music.<br />

part time.<br />
<br />
two years ago i ended a long term relationship. now that i have
moved on i am enjoying some of the things i did not have time to
do. however, i have realized that they are not as fulfilling
without someone to share them with.<br />
<br />
while i prefer nice looking women with curvy hips and round rear
ends , i realize that real beauty comes from within. so, i can be
equally attractve to a woman who is fluffy, a liitle overweight or,
for that matter, full figured if she is caring, enjoys laughter,
and has a good heart.<br />
<br />
with respect to me, i have had three successful careers and have a
passion for giving back to the commnity to help those who have not
been as fortuante. i am a people person who can make coversation,
as well as be a great listener. although i am a worldy man, i can
be sensitiive , caring and compassionate. i have been told numerous
times that i have a very nice voice too.<br />
<br />
whe it comes to my interest, i love to dance and enjoy working out,
but definitely am not a jock. i like going to community plays, the
movies, concerts, the theatre, playing cards, ping pong. i embrace
diversity, love stimulating conversations and ( while it might not
float my boat), flexible enough to do some of the things my
companion has an interest in.<br />
<br />
when it comes to music i love the oldies, r&amp;b, anything by
motown ( especially marvin gaye, smokey robinson and the
temptations), jazz vocals, soft rock, blues, salsa &amp; zydeco
music, and a little country western.<br />
<br />
to sum it up, i am just an average looking guy who values
integrity, tries to be a gentlemen at all times, and is not needy
or greedy. what i am seeking is companionship, or possibly a
relationship with that woman who seeking a decent guy and is asking
herself where all the good men are ?<br />

have to lose? the worst you can do is to make a friend.","retired, and developing initiatives where i can use my experience

professions, most of my reading i did was required reading to
keep<br />
abreast of the latest changes or news media events that
impacted<br />
the areas i worked in. i however just completed reading a book
on<br />
borderline personality disorders and several on terrorism.<br />
<br />
i like oldie but goodies, jazz, r&amp;b, light rock, and some<br />
country &amp; western and blues. love the do wops and the
motown<br />
sound with smokey robinson, the temptations and marvin gaye.
like<br />
soft music, with lyrics i can understand. that's why i can't
deal<br />
with rap and music which sounds like just a lot of noise.<br />
<br />
i don't go to the movies very much because i don't have anyone
to<br />
go with. however, i love the movies. i enjoy comedies,
action,<br />
drama, suspense, science fiction and westerns. i even enjoy
some<br />

now. i moved out here to be a stage manager in theatre, then moved
on to video production, freelanced for a while, and finally landed
in marketing at a start-up. i like being creative and supporting
the arts, so i go to a lot of plays and museums. my friends tell me
i'm easy-going and really laidback, but my mother says otherwise.

dinner, a good book, falling asleep on the beach... i've also been
told that i give really good advice (though when it comes to my own
life, i never follow it).<br />

i spend a lot of time traveling, have lived abroad, etc. my mother
is german, so i've been all over europe but have barely seen any of
the u.s. i try to go back to texas as often as i can, to visit my
huge family (4 brothers, 8 nieces &amp; nephews - christmas is

opinions and thus challenge me. i like being outdoors and active,
but i go through my lazy, sedentary periods.","outside of my ""normal"" job, i freelance as an events planner and a
stage manager, so my weekends and weeks can get pretty booked with
rehearsals. but if i'm not in the middle of a show or event, i
spend a lot of time with friends out enjoying the city. i go to the
beach every chance i get. i work a ton so i can travel or have
spontaneous fancy dinners with friends - there are too many good
restaurants in this city to pass up.","laughing...and being sassy. talking about world events

which has led me to eat fish eyes and frog legs (which then caused
my vegetarian best friend to throw up). i have a huge sweet

in terms of music, i'm eclectic. i'll listen to my favorite cd/song

just want an extended, one-partner deal of company and snuggles

contemplative and reflective rather than impulsive; quietly
confident without pretention or arrogance. i'm the realist who sees
through the spin. ""small is the number of them that see with their
own eyes, and feel with their own hearts.""<br />

physically, i exercise regularly, am in good shape and take healthy
care of myself (mostly, occasional haagen-dazs splurges exempted).
i'm attracted to a woman who does the same.<br />
<br />
for fun, i play a solid game of tennis  up for a hit, or a lesson?
i enjoy going to sharks' hockey games (i am canadian!). i also like
hiking mt tam and muir woods, watching films (especially
independent ones), reading, comedy clubs, and bbqs with
friends.<br />
<br />
i truly enjoy meeting interesting people, from a diversity of
backgrounds (geographic, cultural, academic, professional, etc.);
with a diversity of talents, experiences, and opinions. this often
leads to arousing conversation, healthy debate, learning,
friendship, and more. i'm very open-minded and attracted to those

patents with nobel laureates and spun off a company), i moved on to
new challenges in finance and now have my own trading business. i
truly love what i do!!<br />

accomplished career in finance. i work hard, continue learning and
accomplishing goals and most importantly have lots of fun along the

hi, i'm ian. i'm here to find a sharp wit and a teasing, crooked
smile. also true love and atlantis, but i'm keeping my priorities
straight.<br />
<br />
i need a steady supply of banter and flirting in my life. it's like
verbal tennis - just sitting there hitting the ball is bland. it's
when the other person keeps hitting it back that things can get all
sweaty. we can go anywhere with each other, and have fun stuck in
traffic on the way there.<br />
<br />
challenge me intellectually, too. i didn't stop educating myself
when it stopped costing me money. i like people with breadth, who
put effort into finding the right answers to their questions, and
who aren't threatened by disagreement.<br />
<br />
these days i'm most interested in why we do the fucked up things we
do. psychology, social science, politics. ugh, politics. why our
insides make us so fascinating and exasperating on the
outside.<br />
<br />
when i was a little kid i played with lego, turned over rocks, and
pulled the pigtails of the girls i liked. that kid grew up but
stayed the same.","i work at a tech company, so in my spare time i try to exercise
entirely different parts of my brain.<br />
<br />
these days writing is my windmill to tilt at. i take classes, wake
up early to write a bit in the morning, and generally try to take
it seriously. i don't expect to make a living at it, but i need a
real goal to keep my creative side running.<br />
<br />
whatever happens next, there are no white picket fences in my
future.","adapting. chatting. pretending i'm evil. meeting imperfect
strangers, and empathizing with imperfect lives. catching frogs,
although i may be a bit rusty. taking charge when nobody else wants
to. keeping promises. cooking with science. directness. doing my
own thing(s).<br />
<br />
i'm really bad at:<br />
<br />
getting to bed on time. getting out of bed on time. regularly
scheduled things (but i floss). holding my liquor, other than in my
hand. talking small. long-distance friendships. reverence. one-word
answers to how's it going? inner peace. taking subtle hints.
getting a tan.","women invariably choose my shirt as the target of a compliment. i
have not, to my everlasting regret, ever heard nice shirt, let's
fuck.<br />
<br />
it's a good sign when the first thing i notice about someone is
their style. norcal dress down culture is a terrible shame.","truth is stranger than fiction, and i like strange.<br />

i throw away the black jellybeans.<br />

all who know me are eventually forced to watch jesus christ vampire

bad movie night. i have a collection of films of the ""so bad it's
good"" variety. i start with the lighter fare, and watch people
laugh because they can't believe what they're seeing and they can't
believe they're laughing at it. i feed them experimental cocktails
in threes, which they have to taste for science to see which is
best.<br />
<br />
finally, when their defenses are down, i spring the main attraction
on them. sometimes i watch peoples' faces when they see romeo and
juliet end up living happily ever after, having discovered they're
siblings and decided to have mutant babies anyway.","if okcupid's personality bars say you are less kinky than average i
raise my eyebrows and try to imagine what it is you don't do. it

go to museums/ exhibitions, travel internationally, roadtrips, the
beach, long movie-nights, try new restaurants, walk over bridges..,
visit new exotic places, and many other things..<br />

i am definitely very ambitious &amp; career-driven, but do know how
to enjoy the more important things in life!<br />
i love to philosophize about life, but need a point where one can
just stop. i love the outdoors &amp; nature (not bugs!), but also
love cool, modern &amp; stylish interiors! i love adventures,
however am more of a ""planned adventure"" kind of type.. at least
the first part of it needs to be planned (when/ how), the rest can
just come by however it may! spontaneity is great - when you're
ready for it!<br />

i have a habit of counting exact change when paying cashiers. i
love to start new personal projects, but usually don't end up
finishing them. i love driving around sometimes and just looking at
homes. don't know much anything architecture, but love looking at
them none the less. i toggle between overeating and working out a
bunch. i enjoy going to the gym, yoga, krav maga, being with
friends, board game nights, making beer and sunday brunch with the
family. some week nights i enjoy switching channels between msnbc
and fox news. sometimes i switch back and forth every 5
minutes.<br />
<br />
i've played different roles at my job. in the end i think it's of
little importance what i do for a living. who i do it with though
is critical. i love my coworkers, free food in the kitchen, plane
trips and dinners to work and schmooze with counterparties,
planning meetings with my team around this or that, and solving
problems in excel. also, office politics there is a drag only once
a year during bonus and promotion season. sometimes i work in
spreadsheets so long i lose all ability to socialize. i can't tell
jokes, laugh or crywell usually i can still cry. those are the
nights when i watch msnbc and fox news. in short, i've been at my
current job for seven years now and still love it.<br />
<br />
i get excited about cooking, but usually don't have energy for it
and eat out a lot. i'm usually a vegetarian, a paleo dieter, a junk
food eater or am living solely off of lemon juice, maple syrup, and
cayenne pepper for 10 days straight. i'm very strict about only
doing one at a time, however.<br />

feel i am part of something larger than myself and that i am

understand something new to them. it's very rewarding.<br />

<br />
wouldn't you really rather meet in a cafe? the park? go to a movie?
i decided i would rather sit down with a person and talk about what
i'd try to squeeze in this box, rather than bother squeezing. after
being on here for a few months (eh...), i have to ask - isn't ok
cupid just like virtual window shopping? i think people have lost
the art of conversation.<br />
<br />
i'll just put this out up front, i'm not ""5' 10"" or above..."" and
don't plan on ""traveling europe.."" taking long exotic holidays, or
doing extreme sports any time soon. i'd rather just put on my
running shoes and find a trail, or go for a nice bike ride. i'm a
single parent so most of those exciting adventures will have to
wait for a few more years. i have other priorities right now.<br />
<br />
however, for future reference - i do think it is important to know
how to say ""please"" and ""thank you"" in the native language when you
travel. ""may i have a beer?"" and ""where is the bathroom?"" come in
handy too. if you can teach me any of those expressions in other
languages, i'd love to get a lesson.<br />
<br />
ok, so lately i've been sick of the ""news"" out of washington, and
i've decided i will never date a republican. sheesh. i'm also
amazed at the repubrlican primaries this year. could they find a
worse collection of cracks and down right scary, out of touch
flakes? the only thing scarier is if one of them got elected... and
they closed sam wo's after 100 years, what would edsel say about
that? no #@% coke, tea... sf is losing its coolness by degrees.
like death from a 1000 cuts.....<br />
<br />
i am also adding that you must love mundane things like the
environment more than the almighty dollar. and you must like
critters that go woof, meow, grrrrr, prrrrr, bzzzzzzz, squeak, and
chirp. along with those that speak other foreign languages =)<br />
<br />
also been thinking that while i do have faith in serendipity, i
have less faith in computer algorithms (there's a $4.99 99/100
word, in honor of our gas prices). and i guess i should also put
some exciting pictures of me with my expensive sports car sans
shirt on here too =) a special note to those who do enjoy reading -
see ""the new yorker's"" article about on-line dating and okc. maybe
free is not always worth it.<br />
<br />
lately i have noticed that okc seems to be ""geographically
challenged"" - why do they match me with women from yuba city?
seriously, i don't think meeting a person who lives more than 25-30
miles from you is realistic???? you will spend more time driving
to/from, then you will with each other on a date.<br />
<br />
i'm going back to my own ""questions"" since most of the ones here
are kind of silly-<br />
<br />
q: if you found a spider in your living room, what would you
do?<br />
q: if a friend asked you to lie for them, would you?<br />
<br />
i got asked about the spiders, ""do you really like spiders...?""
well actually yes. i'm not saying anyone has to kiss one, or have a
housefull of them, but i don't go around stomping on them.<br />
<br />
i see that okcupid swiped my spider question. maybe my lies
question too? should i charge okc for stealing my
content.....?<br />
<br />
as for the question about lying, isn't that really what's wrong
with our government and wall street? be with the 99%, ows or okc.","getting into trouble...","finding creative ways to get out of trouble.","that either i have a very furry shadow, or a rather large dog that
generally hangs around with me.","books? movies? shows?... what to say.. sometimes i binge, but not
on food ~/o i used to binge on authors and read everything they
wrote like vonnegut, or hesse, or kesey. hemingway and fitzgerald?
i read some where you can tell things about a person depending on
which of the 2 they prefer. i have read my share of the classics,
authors of the 30s and 40s. beat writers, off beat writers, social
commentary, cultural anthropology, black humor and political
satire.<br />
<br />
reading ""the new yorker"" and ""national geographic"" a lot these
days... yeah, i am part nerd. oh, and i watch tavis smiley too, so
shoot me. definitely not a fan of ayn rand, or ultra-conservatives,
ultra-femminists or ultra-ultra wanna be types.<br />
<br />
movies? i generally go for the ones where i know i like the
director's style. ok, i'll drop some names. aside from the obvious
like scorsese, the coen brothers, fincher, altman, mamet... almost
forgot kubrick. i love herzog, wenders, ozu, itami, kurasawa,
fellini, yimou zhang, tian-ming wu, there are many missing from
this list. i took the test to see which director would make the
movie of my life and it came out with kurasawa. pretty cool since i
do love his movies.<br />
<br />
i'm all over the musical map so i don't even think i'll try put
that in this little box. billie holiday can be nice to unwind to.
the chilli peppers or some good old school funk can be good to
windup to.<br />
<br />
okc... i guess i will expand on the music front - east coast =
todd, patti smith, bruce, lou.. no last names required, except some
people might not get patti smith. english mod &amp; rockers, yeah
the ""invasion"" both i and ii, which would include the clash. i get
into some so-called ""art rockers"" like peter gabriel. sly &amp; the
family stone.. yeah the west coast, the doors &amp; 60s psychedelic
bands and santana. then there is motown, funk, south african root
bands, youssou n'dour, cuban, bahia, ryuichi sakamoto, kodo,
ondekoza.... mozart, tchaikovsky, gershwin, big band jazz, maybe
some hawaiian slack-key guitar.<br />
<br />
it's *not* only rock &amp; roll, get off my cloud. remember what
coltrane said - ""damn the rules, it's the feeling that counts. you
play all twelve notes in your solo anyway..."" or bootsy - don't
fake the funk or your nose will grow. we'd have to put on some
tunes and talk over a few glasses of wine. much better than writing
snarky things here. oh, but whatever we listen to will sound better
on vinyl.<br />
<br />
food is best when cooked with friends and shared. i'm pretty brave

i've spent many late nights hovering over a drafting table or
scrunching over a sketchbook. i usually draw when it's too late at
night to do anything else. unfortunately once i get an idea i have
to run with it which keeps me up even later than i would have liked
in the first place. not only does the drawing keep me awake but the
music that is almost always playing in the background. i always
want to hear one more song or finish the album if that's what's on
the playlist. music is an integral part of my life. i'm surprised i
don't have a record collection (update: finally bought a record
player and started collecting). i remember different parts of my
life through the songs/albums/bands i was listening to at that
particular time. the only time i don't want to listen to music is
when i'm on my bike. i prefer to hear traffic sneaking up behind
me. i try to ride to work as much as possible. not because i want
to save the planet or because i can't afford the gas, but because i
just like to ride. sometimes as fast as possible while dodging
buses and taxis and other times just enjoying the sun because i'll
be indoors the rest of the day. when the weather is good on the

exchange jokes and tell funny/embarrassing stories with friends. i
don't take life too seriously, just enough to not suck at it. as

21,"thin","","rarely","never","graduated from college/university","i always find these ""describe yourself"" things so awkward. it seems
like there's no way to write it all out without coming across as
either arrogant or insane. that's just because a simple text blurb
is, frankly, no way to get to know a person. nothing can substitute
for the little things in getting to know one another. texting each
other every day, or lounging around on the couch doing nothing in
particular but loving each second of it. anyways, i'm starting to
ramble already, so i'll lay down a few basic facts about myself and
then hopefully, if you're interested, we can find out what each
other is really like by chatting some more.<br />
<br />
i can confirm that first and foremost i am a hopeless romantic.
even when the odds are telling me that love won't work out, i have
no choice but to hope with every fiber of my being that it will.
it's in my nature. that said, i try to be realistic about things
even though my inner romantic may say otherwise. it... doesn't
always work out.<br />
<br />
i can also say for certain that i will probably act like a complete
idiot when meeting you in person for the first time. i'm not great
with meeting people, but i really enjoy the time that i spend with
them after clearing that initial hurdle. i can be shy or a bit dry
when meeting up at first, but that's just because i like to take my
time and size up a person before really digging in to the
relationship. if it helps, i've been told i'm hilarious by people
who i've known for a long time.<br />
<br />
i work for a small video game journalism website. what that means,
essentially, is that i critique new video games, keep a blog of the
latest news, and occasionally go to events or conventions like
comic con or pax up in seattle. for the uninitiated, think of it
kind of like a movie critic, but for games. i realize that claiming
to be so deeply invested in the video game business tends to paint
a very specific picture of me, but it's one that is largely
inaccurate. i may fumble in early social interactions, but i also
find that many of the people in the industry are just a little (or
sometimes, a lot) too ""nerdy"" for me. don't get me wrong, i love
nerdy girls, but to an extent. i really occupy a weird middle
ground between huge nerd and average joe. i'm down for a game of
magic or some xbox, but i can't do that stuff for extended periods.
i need to get out and go hiking or walking or something too.<br />
<br />
oh, and i don't really drink. it's not that i never have
(ironically enough, i never have since turning 21) or that i have
something against it, but i just don't understand why i would.
downing some foul-tasting drink just to lower my iq doesn't sound
like a ton of fun, unless we're all going to be sitting around
playing cards against humanity or kinect all night. going hand in
hand with that, i don't like clubbing much either. i know, i'm a
real stick in the mud.<br />
<br />
anyways, that's me in a nutshell. i don't want to keep this going
for too long, but if you're at all curious i can at the very least
promise you'll get some humor out of my idiotic attempts at
socializing with you. that's sarcasm. hopefully.<br />

so i joined this website to use a quiz to resolve a political

totally a liberal, but don't want government control. hrmph. no
contradictions there. :)<br />

now that i know more about myself than any thirteen people need to
know, what am i still doing here? can i accept a computer telling
me i'm less than 95% complete, because i haven't posted enough
lengthy journal entries?<br />
<br />
why does this thing keep telling me i need to add to my summary? is
it counting my words, and there's an arbitrary number over which
the server determines you are whole? although it's really great to
know i'm only a 98% friend with myself. (is that a diagnosis of a
2% self destructive streak then?)<br />
<br />
why does this thing think i'm less spiritual? just because i didn't
answer yeah to something about jesus, again? not a fan of the
zombie gods. why are those questions even on here? don't they know
only heathens use the internet? christians are in church praying
for my soul. i'm reading suzuki on zen, again. i'm friggin'
soulful, maybe a little sour on organized religion, but i
appreciate the breeze moving a field of wildflowers, the sound of
water on rock, the buzz-on of a healthy gin-on, feet cold without
metaphor, and the essence of the now more than then, always more

okc is entirely based on statistics, fancy math with crazy vectors
like lazers at a dance club, and to allow this site to work,
participants (the dancing freaks) need to answer a sufficient
number of questions honestly, otherwise the matches will be skewed
and we won't click. (you out there with the squeeky dolphin fetish,
we'll just be friends, ok? no judgements.) a personal goal is to
complete all of the match questions and make most of them public,
which is quite difficult because some of those questions are just
awfully stupid. i'd like to meet someone who has also answered a
lot, even if some questions have no meaning. and the weighting
system means that 50 questions ranked at irrelevant are equal to
one mandatory question.","i'm not too sure about this, does anyone really know? no, i guess

more simply, developing some concepts of happiness in a screwed up

happiness. it's ok to think seriously, but laughter sustains you
through the serious stuff. happiness is not a box of chocolates,
it's giving the chocolates.<br />

lovewise? some cheesey analogy regarding love should go here, but
that would be, like totally lame. more simply, i'm looking for

despite the note above concerning forgetting nearly every name, i
am good at making memories. by forcing myself to connect disparate
senses with events, like imagining the smell of coffee when meeting
someone, i can remember their names! connecting sounds with names
is also quite a fun game, but i mostly use this as a reinforcement
mechanism to remember those worthwhile moments. and amazingly, i
seem to be able to forget names at will, some of the folks that
have traipsed through my life are nothing more than a memory of
their music collection.<br />

computers, since the age of four, has guided most of my life. i was
born in denver, moved to the rocky mountains, then a suburb of
buffalo, then nefarious places in southern ontario canada, then
just outside of toronto to go to the school i ended up dropping out
of to move to san francisco and work as an ios developer.<br />

i was just out of college and became really good friends with one
of the engineers who was in his early 60's; i'm hip to the elderly.
he was going through a few really rough months - lost his younger

me 1) when you're my age you won't regret the risks you took,
you'll regret the risks you didn't take 2) if you ever find
yourself bored with life, make a change 3) don't have any
regrets.<br />
<br />
his advice resonates in everything i do. my goal in life is to live
it, take risks, have no regrets, and meet amazing people along the
way. i added that last part because at the end of the day, people
are what make life enjoyable. otherwise you'd be sitting around
alone, and who would want to do that?!?","talking my way out of traffic tickets. although i got one last 4th

<br />
i find live standup comedy to be the most honest performance art.
there is no backup band, dazzling visuals or understudy. its about
one person, a mic and the desire to connect with audiences of
varying drunkenness through laughter. forget the hack sessions you
may have seen on cable tv, the recipe for winning over a live crowd
acculturated to heckle you is: honesty. the mc's and feature acts
with their rinse and repeat punchlines are working towards this.
true masters of the craft share their unique perspective on the
world with us. it may be exaggerated, cynical, dark, dirty, absurd,
cerebral or silly... but if the crowd left in tears, it was an
honesty shot to the heart, pulp fiction style.<br />

i've been around the world, too. i spent my high school summers
doing exchanges, scholarship and work in europe. i've lived abroad
in adulthood as well. (i speak german and have pleasantries in all
the majors). after this exposure and rhythm, i surrendered any
notion of national allegiance. i could be happy just about
anywhere. in addition to shedding braincells but gaining
inspiration throughout europe, i've spent time in asia, central
america, islands, and a beautiful, often underrated zone called
north america. in march i'll be headed to a place that legal
council has recommended i not mention online. it rhymes with
tuba.<br />

i write in spurts. it took me over a year to finish my book
(""fictional exaggerations of reality"", lulu, 2010). i find writing
to be like flossing: sometimes its a chore to get started but i've
never finished and thought to myself that it was a waste of time.
to keep motivated, i started a little collective of bay area
writers. if you can spend hours on vice ""dos and don'ts"", we'd love

i am your typical guy, but in other ways i am not. how am i not,
you ask? mostly it boils down to geekiness. i love nature, animals,
the sciences, and somewhat ironically, science fiction. i also am
quite affectionate.<br />
<br />
i try to surround myself with what i love. i am a big train buff,
so i got a job with a railroad. i am an animal lover, thus am
currently at the beck and call of two cats. (i love dogs also, but
don't want to subject one to apartment living.) i read about the
sciences, and i hike (or kayak when the opportunity presents
itself) to get back to nature. all i need now is someone to lavish
affection on, thus this profile on okcupid.<br />
<br />
i also like to travel, and have traveled a fair amount in my life
thus far, but would like to do much more. i have traveled
throughout the u.s. (have been to alaska, but not hawaii) and some
of europe (germany, italy and france).","working, enjoying rainy days, enjoying sunny days, petting cats,
occasionally sleeping...","photography, inspecting and repairing freight cars (i have an

animals, wine tasting, laughing...","whatever it is, they haven't told me!","books: i have traditionally read mostly textbooks (school) and
short stories (also school). both are still good, but i would like
to get back into novels.<br />
<br />
movies: most of the james bond series (especially daniel craig),
the original star wars trilogy (and also the last half or so of
episode iii), tim burton's and christopher nolan's incarnations of
batman, the godfather 1 and 2, defiance, pan's labyrinth, hellboy
(deep breath), the hunt for red october, lucky number slevin, from
paris with love, pirates of the caribbean, airplane!, spaceballs,
monty python, and many others.<br />
<br />
shows: mostly stuff that isn't on anymore, but i can thankfully get
on dvd! i.e. mystery science theater 3000, star trek: the next
generation (i grew up on that show), chappelle's show, the x-files,
and older episodes of csi (the original). also futurama, venture
brothers, robot chicken, and when i can, almost anything from the
history, military or discovery channels.<br />
<br />
music: movie soundtracks and classic rock by far. since no one else
is really into movie soundtracks, i will just list my favorite
classic rock groups: the beatles, led zeppelin, the doors, cream,
queen, neil young and many other near-favorites. i also like modern
rock (the offspring, system of a down, green day etc.) and some rap
(mostly eminem).<br />
<br />
food: pretty much anything. i love bbq, and just about anything
curried. which means that i love thai and indian. but also mexican,

60,"fit","mostly vegetarian","socially","never","graduated from ph.d program","i had forgotten i had not filled out these sections and now i know
why: it's not easy. i am more educated than i have ever needed to
be, and have spent most of my working life traveling and working in
the most esoteric of fields, and have loved it. my kids are mostly
through college and their mother graciously lives on the east
coast. liberal is a conservative way to describe my politics. i
have moved seven time in the past ten years, but hope i am settled
here for the foreseeable future. i read often, most recently ""night
train to lisbon: and ""this is your brain on music."" skiing is my
most recent rediscovery. although i like the female presence in my
life, i am not sure that it has to be just one for the rest of the
journey. i appreciate the depth and value of a close personal
connection, and usually find myself committed to the detriment of
my sense of self expression. perhaps the right woman will ease my
way through this?<br />
<br />
i am generous to a fault, interesting, and open minded<br />
<br />
now, i just don't get the one and only thing about seeking to meet
someone online. i cannot imagine meeting someone with the intention
that i am seeking to spend the rest of my life with them.<br />
i think that would get in the way of relating naturally to each
other. i have nothing against a good committed relationship, but to
think this is it when i seek to meet someone here just does not
connect to me. about the most i would want when i meet someone here
is that i have a good enough time that i would want to meet again.
and then next time, i would like the same, and if it continues like
that then a truly involved relationship will develop, if that is
where we both want it to go. yes, i have been known to not see it
when it is there. you know ... smack on the forehead ... what was i
thinking??? but i am not inclined to tell others what to do, and if
your having fun, there is no need to push. what works for me is for
each of us to be enjoying the moment for all that it is. the rest,
whatever that may, be will follow from that.<br />
<br />
and then there is ambition. what's that all that about? i have
multiple graduate degrees, and have worked most of my working life
in the most esoteric of fields and loved it, but i have never had
any desire to win or reach some far off goal. i have no trouble
deciding to do something and doing it, but it does not feel like
ambition to me. i do not like to tell others what to do. managing
others to me is working with them in a collaborative way, with each
and every one welcome to contribute in their way. i have played
sports like hockey and soccer, or tennis and squash, but rather
than trying to beat the others, i usually feel that i am just
developing skills that are fun to use. and it is fun, not
conquest.<br />
<br />
hmmm ... i guess that is part of the thing i realized after my most
recent divorce. i have lived my life in a power struggle. it is
time for that to end. relationship is not about a power struggle,
someone has to lose. i have no desire for the person i am in
relationship with to lose, and neither do i wish to lose. resolving
differences does not have to be a win/lose matter. i will not be in
another relationship that is a power struggle. in a former life i
was an attorney, and then realized i do not like to fight. it took
me a little longer to figure out the i do not like to fight in
relationship either.","living and enjoying it.","synthesizing a wide assortment of information into unexpected

i never feel as proud of myself as when i make a really good

<br />
i'm a computer/tech guy for my day job, so i love being outside
when i'm not at work. i go road biking and running a lot. i love
camping and hiking and getting dirty and sweaty. i just joined a
summer ultimate frisbee league, and my goal is to lay out more than
anyone else on my team. after our first game, i'm well on my way. i
also love disc golf and squash. i'd like to try rock climbing

went wrong. at least i got a couple of good stories out of
them.<br />

i think the world would be a much happier place if it were socially
acceptable to communicate by singing. until recently, i sang in a
jazz a cappella group in berkeley. now i sing in a quartet and a
larger group at work; we rehearse on company time (shh, don't tell
anyone). i also play guitar decently, and piano and banjo
poorly.<br />

evolution of human sexuality).<br />
<br />
<em>movies</em>: lost in translation, the big lebowski, blood
diamond, children of men, the usual suspects.<br />
<br />
<em>music</em>: music is my biggest passion in life. right now, i'm
mostly listening to electronic, jazz, and brazilian (samba and
bossa nova), but i enjoy almost everything. i'm definitely not
above blasting and singing along to backstreet boys and n'sync in
the car. my coworkers give me funny looks when i start dancing or
humming while i'm wearing headphones at my desk. when i get bored
of my usual rotation, i host music sharing parties so i can
discover new stuff from friends.<br />

<br />
movie-wise, i prefer indies and foreign cinema over big-budget

struggles, and protests that are important to me.<br />
<br />
i believe in fighting hard and playing hard. when i'm not
organizing, i'm out hiking a trail with my dog, biking up tunnel rd
with my friends, hitting the climbing gym, running the lake under

but here are some of my recent faves in each category:<br />
<br />
<strong>books:</strong> books are among my favorite things in life!
i read a combination of nerdy labor history and movement strategy,
and some occasional fiction. i'm trying to read more books in
spanish. in dubious battle, the immortal life of henrietta lacks,
little bee, zeitoun, why david sometimes wins, restoring the power
of unions, union of their dreams, ms alla de mi, casas de carton,
the lacuna, playbook for progressives, solidarity divided. oh and
the hunger games!!<br />
<br />
<strong>movies:</strong> i adore documentaries, and watch alot of
movies in spanish. tambien la lluvia, los invisibles, princesas,
salt of the earth.<br />
<br />
<strong>shows:</strong> i don't own a tv. and i like it like that.
though i sometimes catch a peak at the daily show or the colbert
report on my laptop.<br />
<br />
<strong>music:</strong> mostly underground, political hip hop and
some spanish rock. ana tijoux, bocafloja, the coup, dead prez,
immortal technique, thievery corporation, los rakas, manu chao,
orishas, ozomatli, rebel diaz.<br />
<br />
<strong>food:</strong> anything vegan. but my favorites are
avocados, sweet potatoes, black beans, kale, strawberries,
blueberries, dark chocolate, siracha, green tea, and red wine. so
many good places around oakland to get vegan sushi, bbq pulled
""pork,"" carmelized ""chicken,"" vegan soul food, vegan notta-ricotta
pizza, vegan donuts and cinnabuns. love all the oakland farmers
markets, esp. the bolani samples.","life has been a process of learning to live without the people and
things i'd previously thought i could never do without, but:<br />
<br />
1. organizing - a good march, sit in, civil disobedience.<br />
2. my doggie - an adorable boxer pitbull mix named paisley.<br />
3. my crew - mi familia y mis compaeros for life.<br />
4. photography - specifically, my nikon d90 and aperture.<br />
5. nature - to be out in the sunshine, wind, stars.<br />
6. endorphins - biking, running, climbing, self-defense, sex.","","not sure about typical, but my last few fridays consisted of:<br />
* tamarind margaritas for a friend's birthday<br />
* vegan soul food with my crew<br />
* greyhounds and mj brass boppers show at van kleef's<br />
* watching project bandaloop on the great wall of oakland<br />
* political debates around a backyard firepit<br />
* fundraiser for a rad movement organization","let's talk about this in person, shall we?","at this point in life, i know what i want - a compaero(a) to
(eventually) really throw down with, be best friends with, build a
life with. i care deeply about, am intrigued by, and enjoy spending
time with all kinds of people. but i've found over the years that
it only really works to partner up with folks for whom social
justice is a central part of their life.<br />

i was just a young man when i left everything i knew in michigan
and hitchhiked from there with 37 cents, a pack of marlboro's in my
pocket, no destination to which i was privy, and an intense desire
to put all my trust in the universe to guide me to where- and what-
ever it was my destiny was to become. i started once i got to the
island of nantucket and didn't stop until i reached san francisco.
(ironically i live on treasure island now.) once i got here i
quickly discovered i neither had enough money or time to be cool. i
spent a few years in a hedonistic hell and emerged with a handful
of skills that showcased the knowledge the universe has provided me
on my journey. i stole every bit of knowledge i have. nothing was
given to me.","this is kinda broad...i write poetry and short fiction. i dabble in
amateur digital photography. i'm an accomplished author and
sometimes am lucky enough to do readings in the city. i freelance
and am constantly working on stuff as a graphic artist. i love
playstation 3. (ok so sue me). i read voraciously. (hiint: do not
ask me if i like the beats) i have a kick ass computer that doubles
as a room when it works. the only things not wired in my bedroom
are my houseplants some of which are carnivorous, but not large
enough to eat the neighbor's loud dog. i agree, it is extremely
unfortunate. there are some bonsais here and there that i attempt
to keep from dying. i love high definition and high resolution
digital music files of great music. i hate mp3's or whatever
lossless iteration they take. i am also a huge fan of multi-channel
audio when done well--if you haven't heard the flaming lips in 5.1
you really should do yourself a favor and experience it. the alan
parsons mix of dark side is also quite amazing. shoplifting
knowledge.","writing. i have a pretty good intuition which also comes in handy.
i am also handy with photoshop and indesign.","is my eyes.","too many too eclectic...like dark stuff. i love certain french
poetry mostly because the translation inspires newer places for my
imagination to drift toward. my favorite poets are those from the
so called silver era of russian poets who were mostly persecuted or
killed under stalin like akhmatova, mandelstam, and others. i also
admire villaurruttia for the one book he wrote which at 50 some odd
pages was all he ever needed to write to secure his seat at the
table of the greats. as you can tell i do not read much after 1950.
musically it need only be of sufficient quality and depth. the
genre is meaningless.","books, toothbrush, pot, computer, sex, music. (people may be added
at a later date)","things i shouldnt spend a lot of time thinking about","baffled.","if it's private you'll have to do some really persuasive things to

<br />
i was born in toronto and raised in a suburb just outside of the
city. despite the cookie-cutter houses, humdrum lifestyle, and my
k-12 experience in catholic schools, i think i turned out to be a
pretty reasonable and open-minded person. you, of course, can make
that judgment for yourself.<br />
<br />
so why am i here now? that's a long story best told in person. i'd
love to hear your story too. i think the way people reflect on
their lives and make sense of their path is utterly fascinating. we
can learn so much by reflecting on our past and listening to other
people's stories.<br />
<br />
full disclosure: i'm in a long-term, long-distance, open
relationship with <a class=""plink"" href=
""/profile/twentyover200"">twentyover200</a>. he is an amazingly
supportive human being, and i'm honored to have him as a partner.
we've spent nine years growing and learning together, but
circumstances (i.e., academic opportunities) have kept us apart for
the last three. after a whole lot of conversation, negotiation, and
personal reflection, we've reached the point that we're both
comfortable exploring relationships with others. we've been doing
this for a while now, and it's been a bumpy (but generally
wonderful) ride. i have a distaste for labels (language is so
imprecise!), so i hesitate to slap any on our relationship or what
we're looking for. the bottom line, though, is that we like people.
we like connecting with people in whatever ways feel right for
everyone involved. send me a message and let's see where life takes
us. though i like to keep busy, i will always make time for the
people most important to me! :)","<b><u>school-wise:</u></b><br />
i read a lot, write a lot, and think a lot. this gets balanced out
by spending some of my week in schools with kids. i love that i get
to wear many different 'hats' in any given week - it prevents me
from getting bored and helps keep me engaged in life. i work best
when i have many things on my plate.<br />
<br />
<b><u>outside of school:</u></b><br />
i'm busily breaking my own preconceived notions of what i'm good at
or capable of. i've always been a bit shy and am not great at
small-talk, but have recently been meeting new people and am really
enjoying all the positive interactions. bring it on, world!<br />
<br />
i've been very focused on academics since arriving here, at the
expense of some other aspects of my life. this year (and beyond), i
want to truly enjoy what the bay area has to offer - new people,
new places, new food, new ideas. over the last few months, i've
taken up some new hobbies - sailing (being on the water is very
calming and soothes my soul in a way that i don't completely
understand), glassworking (very meditative), and ceramics/pottery
(who doesn't love getting their hands messy with a big pile of
clay?). i also love cooking, but only when i have someone to share
the food with. if you have a hobby or activity that you want to
share, please let me know!","- one-on-one conversation<br />

and people. i love kids, animals and nature. i think written word
is beautiful, and will own a home library one day. i like old
things, including people. anything with history behind it. i love
cooking and baking; my food allergies have caused me to be halfway
decent at both. i want to live by the beach at some point in my
life. i can't explain myself well, but i'm always willing to
try.<br />
<br />
most importantly, i'm not a 'hit it and quit it' kinda girl. i'm
not interested in being 'friends with benefits' or hooking up, and
i'm not looking for love either. <strong>all i want is a chill guy
friend.</strong>","when i'm not homeschooling my little brother, i'm usually off
babysitting. i spend a majority of my time around kids; sometimes
they're better company than adults are.","making the same mistakes twice. i don't learn lessons well,
evidently.<br />
i'm really good at poking fun at myself. i have a good sense of
humor, so i'm not opposed to flirty teasing. i'm also really good
at blushing too. it's a curse.","that i don't act my age. most people assume i'm in my mid-twenties,
and they deflate a little when i tell them i'm not.","my favorite books are: the harry potter series, the alchemist by
paulo coelho and my antonia by willa cather.<br />
<br />
my favorite movies are: pulp fiction, the boondock saints, the big
lebowski and grumpy old men. i adore black &amp; white movies
though; anything with jimmy stewart or humphrey bogart. you can't
take it with you, the cheyenne social club, casablanca. i also
believe you're never too old to watch disney or pixar movies. and
corny 80's movies have a soft spot in my heart too.<br />
<br />
as far as tv shows, i don't watch much tv. i am a fan of weeds
though. and i will admit that i'm a gleek (but not an obnoxious
one, i do have some dignity.) community, united states of tara,
modern family and breaking bad are some new favorites, too.<br />

wittiest, most hilarious show out there then don't bother messaging

<br />
i grew up on country music, but i only listen to it now when i'm
feeling nostalgic. i love classic rock and oldies. r&amp;b, jazz
and easy listening are great too. anything but rap or techno,
basically. although i do like some house music.<br />
<br />
i'm pretty picky when it comes to food because i have allergies.
i'm allergic to cocoa (anything chocolate) and tree nuts (as well
as peanuts). it majorly limits the types of restaurants i can eat
at, but i'm a pretty swell cook/baker now because of it. i'm always
down for hamburgers and fries though! a cheap date, really.","epipen<br />

where can i get away with night time skating? i'm too chicken to
skate during the day at a skate park with other skaters around

would be provided in the near future? (bonus points if you get the

blah blah blah that everyone else says in these things. one cannot
possibly get an idea of who someone is after reading a few short
paragraphs about them. actually having a conversation with the
person attains far more advantageous outcomes. i am a very honest
and straight-to-the-point type of person, no beating around the
bush although sometimes i will sugar-coat things to prevent any
hurt feelings. we all live on a minute to minute basis and i don't
like to waste any time, being that it is such a precious gift. but

quickly. why people so often do not act like their true selves. why
we don't make more friends. why we don't love each other more

heterosexual male and yes i do find sex appealing but i have a near
violent aversion to it due to a previous relationship and i view
all who can enjoy carnal pleasures with bitter contempt and
jealously. i bear similar feelings towards those who hold hands in
public. it's not their fault, i am just angry and bitter. i am
often described as morose and an amazing orson welles look alike.

differences, oddities, interests, senses of humor, what causes them

common ground or explore how interesting our differences are. i'm

like books about mountain climbing, exploring, being lost at sea,
biographies, animals, science fiction (not fantasy.) i'm now

i embrace my creative and rational selves. i use both of them in my

science, constitutional law, psychology, sociology, and
economics.<br />

being raised in a house full of women, i must say i was constantly
exposed to many loves stories, chic flicks etc. i'm pretty sure
some of that romance &amp; ideas have rubbed off on me. am i a
hopeless romantic? how does laying on a row boat on a calm stream
in each others arms, eating grapes, drinking wine and some brie
sound?<br />

the brunt: i have been married for over 5 years. we are in a

seeing and why and how. so if you don't understand this sort of
relationship arrangement, please don't bother messaging me.<br />

some things i am passionate about:<br />

1) deep relationships (community/family) and what it means to have
healthy ones<br />

3) food -- finding awesome food spots, and i enjoy cooking too!","i teach guitar and music theory for a living.<br />

christopher nolan, the coen brothers, wes anderson, paul thomas
anderson, and more. i like anything with a powerful narrative, and
films that have challenging themes. i enjoy brainless action flicks
from time to time and i find crude movies, pranks, and awful stuff

in a fire. i dressed warmly, put all my journals and my laptop in a
bag, then stood to consider what else should go. then the fire was
put out.<br />
<br />
one of my jobs is a mildly frustrating writing-related job, but
it's still writing-related. one of my jobs is a great customer
service job, but it's still service. i like 'em, but i'm still
working on the job part of living here (more editing, less
service); i moved here for other reasons.<br />
<br />
i just moved to a new apt., so i've been in piecemeal-home
improvement mode: dreaming up uses for the space, painting,
scrubbing the bad, pre-existing paint job from the tile... i need
to build some basic ones first, but i've been dreaming of slanted
display shelves ( la <i>melancholia</i>) so i can have a
changeable gallery of books.<br />
<br />
looking through the first of the aforementioned journals, from an
unexpectedly early age 10, i'm surprised when i find that i wanted
to be an author. i remember my love of language and writing coming
much later. a veterinarian, my 3rd choice (after a baffling
""chemist""), is what i've always remembered wanting as a child to
be. i apparently also thought o.j. was guilty, and my favorite show
was ""mcgiver.""<br />
<br />
i am perpetually, poorly, learning french. a few years in college,
some fitful self-teaching, poor attempts at reading, and lots of
french film have given me a basic grasp, but my memory is poor for
vocab that isn't actively used, and the more complex syntax still
trips me up. i sometimes enjoy an evening working my way through a
(stanza or two, really, of a) poem with my oxford french/english,
though, and comparing it to other translations, mallarm and
roubaud of late.<br />
<br />
since mention of origins seems obligatory here, i'll say that
people are often surprised to learn i'm from mississippi, as i have
no discernible accent. it only comes out in a few words (""ya'll,""
""fixin'""), or if i've just talked to my family. i miss
mississippi's food and land, but san francisco's landscape is a
surprisingly good approximation of mississippi's, weather
excepting; the thickness of the foliage in golden gate park was one
of many things i fell in love with on my first visit here. you can
see that reaction to golden gate park in the last photo.","i feel i've spent most of my life learning, but san francisco is
about doing, so i'm working on doing. i'm still learning, of
course, but trying to focus on the doing. it's one of the reasons i
moved here. i've been lucky enough to meet some fascinating and odd
people here to help me along. the typical answer to this question
is about work, though; and while i enjoy my work, it isn't ""what
i'm doing with my life."" it would be great to merge the
money-earning and the doing, but until i figure that out, i do my
money-earning as a writing coach in an online college's writing
center. i also work in a museum store and sometimes in a bookstore.
i'd like to do more of the latter. when i'm not working, i'm
reading books, looking at art, working with friends to brainstorm
and plan parties we can throw in interesting, unused or non-public
spaces, exploring the city, going to movies that's the stuff that
i'm ""doing with my life."" that and fantasizing about a phd in art
history. but i need to get bored with not being in school first,
and i've been plenty busy for that to not happen.","justifying why i just bought that book.","","this is a dangerous section. i have two degrees whose fundamental
subjects are ""thinking about why i like what i like."" but rather
than divulge my personal aesthetic philosophy (that's more of a
third-date topic, no?), i'll just say, these are some
artists/works/topics which i like/will always love/am recently

beckett, james merrill, peter handke, gabriel josipovici, marianne
moore, proust, thoreau, yeats, william gaddis, edouard vuillard,
matisse, clyfford still, david park, john baldessari, the books,
schubert's winterreise, bach's cello concertos, rem, titian,
tintoretto, paul celan, muriel spark, ivy compton-burnett, georges
perec, classical greece, robert bresson, rw fassbinder, michael
haneke, von trier, hans arp, alexander archipenko, and the list
goes on... i've been watching a lot of wong kar-wai lately. the
triple-feature at the castro cinched my desire to seek out
everything by him, rather than just come across it when i do.<br />
<br />
i like a lot of tv, too: community, nurse jackie, venture bros.,
himym, mad men, desperate housewives, weeds, six feet under.
raising hope has been making me laugh lately.<br />
<br />
as far as food goes, i really like foodi <em>am</em> from
mississippii'm not picky, i like eating out, and i'll at least try
most anything. i'm omnivorous, but i try to eat veggie-style at
least as often as i don't. favorites are indian and sushi. i'm on a
continual hunt for good southern food here. i still can't quite
believe that the only good fried okra in the bay area comes from a
vegan restaurant [edit: blue jay caf's otherwise
disappointing-to-acceptable southern fare made the sublimity of its
fried okra unexpected; sorry vegan okra, but you've been
dethroned.]. and if you're wondering, brenda's has the best shrimp
and grits, but not the best beignets.","1. books.<br />
2. nice days, weather-wise (try living in england for a year), and
beautiful land to spend them wandering over (try living in england
for the relevant two months).<br />
3. two or three very close friends, among a larger group.<br />
4. curiosity (and curious people).<br />
5. a public library which grants me access to the online oed so i
can access the oed when i'm not next to my copy of the oed.<br />

a little addicted to yoga. but do you know how wonderful it feels

flat on your ass? maybe you do. i haven't exercised regularly
before the past year (if you don't count walking everywhere). this
is a new thing for me. it's fun.<br />
<br />
but, ya know, the standard stuff, too: men, sex, social
interaction, friends, whether anyone wants to go to dinner or i
should just make a salad, whether it's worth $2.50 to walk an extra
three blocks to that atm, how i'm going to be a better person at
doing everything next week... also, grammar. and whether we'll get
caught next time.","","","well, i've somehow ended up living in san francisco and hanging out

no way to live. so i took a year sabbatical. considering that i
don't even own a passport, i figured it was best to remedy that
before i grew up and became an ""adult."" it would be amazing to find
someone special to enjoy all this free time with. thus this crazy
dating site. however, first stop, bali!<br />
<br />
with that said, i am a very hard worker and keep busy most of the
time. i have two occupations, mechanical engineer and drum builder.
i started a new gym rock climbing. love it... got ride of the car
as well. that felt amazing as well.<br />
<br />
i enjoy a nice night out on the town or even a chill night at home
with some good food and a bottle of wine. i love food, so i like
checking out new hot spot restaurants, especially in the city. some
waves, a good scotch and a fire pit on a nice summer evening are
also a must. i have a pug by the name of walter. he is definitely
my co-pilot. i also have a few tattoos, if you didn't notice in
some of my pictures. i have no kids (other than walt of course), no
drama, just fun and hard work. that's pretty much me.<br />
<br />
im looking for aomeone i can take home to mom and dad but still
whisper inappropriate things in my ear at inappropriate times.
someone who like dogs, cause walt goes everywhere with me. someone
that like the outdoors. goal oriented, independent and sexy are all
traits i look for as well.<br />

message me if you dig. would love to meet some cool new people.

i've been told on occasion that i talk like woody allen (about 5
times in the last 6 years) and look like tobey maguire/peter parker
(about 4 times in the last 7 years).&nbsp; i've also been told that
i look like harry potter (data unavailable).","<strong>books</strong><br />
well, i haven't really read much that's not related to my academic
interests. but some fiction books/series i remember quite enjoying
are the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, the neverending story,
c.s. lewis' space trilogy, and 1984.&nbsp; some ""nonfiction"" books
i've enjoyed include goedel, escher, bach; david griffiths' physics
books; and david lewis' on the plurality of worlds. i must also say
that the crc handbook of chemistry and physics (86th ed.) is an
absolutely thrilling read. i've probably read that little book nine
times. personally, though, i think everything after the 87th
edition is crap.<br />
<br />
<strong>movies</strong><br />
some favorites: romantic comedies that feature meg ryan, romantic
animated films that feature wall-e, sci-fi flicks that are not
necessarily romantic but which feature y-wings, 2001, the sound of
music, the truman show, being john malkovich, woody allen stuff.
(note: i got into woody allen <em>after</em> people told me i
reminded them of him, so please don't think i somehow idolize him!
there are a lot of things about that man that shouldn't be...
idolized.)<br />
<br />
<strong>shows</strong><br />
among shows that are currently on the air, my 5 favorite are mad
men, breaking bad, dexter, curb your enthusiasm, and peep
show.&nbsp; among shows that are now off the air, my 6 favorite are
(possibly) lost, battlestar galactica, arrested development, the
office (uk; and also the earlier days of the american version),
seinfeld, and the larry sanders show.<br />

sigur ros, arcade fire, muse, daft punk, beatles, beach boys, simon

<br />
<strong>food</strong><br />
short answer: pizza. slightly longer answer: prior to a year ago, i
disliked the taste of almost every food there is. (it's a long and,
i'm told, fascinating story.) however, last summer i learned how to
tolerate most (ordinary) foods, and i think i can say that i now
even ""like"" many of them and actually enjoy the process of trying
new things. that said, i'm still very ignorant about what foods are
out there. so, show me some more food!","(1) long solitary walks<br />

never do without.","the nature of (linguistic) meaning; the extent to which reality has
any ""structure""; the extent to which various metaphysical questions
are substantive (e.g., are questions of existence to be settled
merely by how we choose to use language?); the extent to which
knowledge or justified belief is so much as possible (e.g., can i
know that i'm not merely part of a computer simulation?); and a
bunch of other issues in philosophy. i also spend a lot of time
thinking about what issues i should be thinking about.<br />
<br />
recently, my will caught up to my sense of rationality, and i'm now
(very) often thinking about what i can do to be healthier. i
seriously think that the changes i've made over the last several
months have added a good 8 years to my life. only infinitely more
to go!<br />
<br />
i also often wonder about what would happen if i acted wildly
inappropriately in a variety of social situations, like if i
randomly started talking like yoda one day with my advisor or if i
serenaded my mailman. would happen good results, hmm?","either studying or relaxing at my apartment or out at some small

use of quasi-technical locutions (like ""quasi-technical

somehow well-read or knowledgeable of the ways of the world.&nbsp;

extensively around the world and believe the world is my oyster.
i'm drawn to cultures different to my own and love the unbeaten
track that takes me to new awakenings in life. yes i know the above
sounds cliche, but i actually live it! i was born to hippy parents
on a commune in tenn. where my parents had taken a vow of poverty.
when i was two months old my family moved to guatemala to help in
the relief efforts after an earthquake killed over 30,000 people
and orphaned over 100,000 children. we lived there for 4 years
after which we moved to california where we settled for about 6
years. we continued to travel about the country, actually 36 states
(8 months), branching out to countries like thailand (6 months) and
mexico (2 months) in search of the perfect haven. my parents never
found their ideal place, but settled on gainesville, florida where
i was home schooled along with my older sister till i graduated. i
left home at 19 to live and work in a community for mentally
handicapped people in upstate new york for a year. i then moved to
paris, france as an au pair for another year. it was while in paris
i discovered my love for salsa dancing. i had been dancing
folkloric dance since i was 10 so always had a passion for dance,
but not quite the passion i developed for salsa. i've been salsa
dancing for over 14 years now and the sound of cuban salsa still
makes my blood boil. after paris i returned to california where i
continued as a nanny for a couple years. i had yet to find my
calling in life so settled on caring for other people's children. i
finally got certified to become a personal chef and have since then
run my own personal chef and catering business (13 years). having
traveled so much growing up i have always appreciated other
cultures through traveling, food, music, and photography. my love
for food is great, though my passion for photography is even
greater. after 4 years of studying photography i'm now balancing my
cooking and photography career.<br />
<br />
these are just a few things that make me tick.<br />
<br />
i love, food, travel, community, photography, laughter, the flavor
of water when parched, the sound of children giggling
uncontrollably, a child's hug, sleeping under the stars, the milky
way, swimming naked at night, sleeping naked, chivalry, pranking,
water fights, the smell of camp fires, the scent of wet earth,
romance, sea glass hunting on the beach, artichokes, oysters, crab
season, my cat's meow, the sun, being outside at all hours on hot
humid nights, cuba, salsa dancing, old weathered hands that have a
story, hearts of palm, nerds (candy), sushi, a first kiss, sex, my
friends, spooning, world issues, sound of rain at night, playing in
the rain, cooking for loved ones, hearing people's stories, road
trips, big and little adventures, camping, making others laugh,
laughing at myself, snuggles, etc..<br />

52,"curvy","","socially","never","graduated from masters program","i would describe myself as a good-humored and easy going woman who
is youthful in my approach to life. i enjoy meeting people and
doing things out and about. conversely, there are times when i just
want to be quiet -- away from the crowd. ideally, quiet and at home
(or on a road trip) with my partner, just enjoying spending time,
touching (both physically and intellectually), laughing and
sharing.<br />
<br />
because i am tall, i project a certain confidence. i laugh from the
heart and am fairly expressive. i am a natural hugger and tend to
be open when interacting with people. yet there is a part of me
that is shy, reserved and private.<br />
<br />
i am optimistic and positive. i try to find the best out of every
situation. i believe in god, prayer, miracles, and that good can
come from challenging or negative situations. differences don't
phase me, it's how you respond to those differences -- be they
politics, race, or other. i am open to meeting and dating people
from other cultures and races, as well as my own. in the end, it's
about how we treat each other and the people we encounter
everyday.<br />
<br />
i work in public relations and am involved in a few community
activities. service and compassion for others is important to
me.<br />
<br />
i enjoy music, good humor and like to travel. live contemporary
jazz performances and latin jazz are among my favorites; gospel,
classical, r&amp;b complete the list but i appreciate all genres of
music. stand up comedy makes me laugh. salsa dancing is my favorite
past time. i am a native californian and enjoy exploring all that
northern california offers. i also have traveled to different
corners of the world.","helping people, working, playing, visiting with friends, touring
beautiful places in the world, salsa dancing, going to jazz
concerts, experiencing each day as a faith walk, checking in and
doing things for my parents (as we are now approaching the time of
role reversal), .... and now for tomorrow's adventures, i will let
you know.","being a supportive friend and encouraging others, mentoring,
writing, making presentations and communicating, resolving
conflicts, meeting deadlines, and planning for adventures,...<br />
and then, on the other hand, i can be really good at doing nothing
at all.","my smile, my shape, my eyes?, ...my hearty laugh, my sultry (some
say) voice when i say hello???.... i don't know. should we meet,
you can tell me.","i am curious about many things and there are many things i like ...
so ""favorites"" compete. let's just say if it makes me smile, it's a
favorite.<br />
but if you need specifics, here are a few --<br />
books: my most recent read ""warmth of other suns"" and lots of
current events / political articles. (i take exception to the
personality guide that claims i am ""less read"" which goes to show
there are flaws in this system. but oh well...)<br />
classic movie favorites: i remember them when i see them, but can
never think of the titles.<br />
music: jazz, r&amp;b, gospel, classical, blues<br />
food: mexican, thai, salads and anything that i can cook...i like
to be creative when i do cook.","1) friends and family<br />
2) the moments in nature that make you go ""ah""... like the colors
of the ocean or leaves or the feeling of a cold breeze..<br />
3) my computer<br />
4) faith, prayer and god<br />
5) ""ultra sheen"" products ( or similar) .... lol!!!<br />
6) ...hmmm whatever it is, i guess i can live without it. ...

<br />
ok, back to my regular profile...<br />
<br />
i give up.<br />
<br />
these are words that i've wanted to say countless times when it has
come to the dating world. i'll admit, despite having been on a fair
number of dates, it has not been an easy path and has oftentimes
been frustrating. one can have so much faith into trying to make
things work with someone until that someone completely rips your
heart apart. yes, i've been there and like how most breakups go, it
was not a smooth recovery. however, what can you do, but leave the
past behind - life goes on and you really have no better choice to
make than to pick yourself up and keep moving on. the world can
indeed be a ruthless, cutthroat place sometimes, but the truth is,
it's really in your hands whether you decide to sink or continue
swimming.<br />
<br />
i've honestly debated several times whether to delete my account
and yet i'm still on here. why? because despite past mistakes and
upsets i've experienced, i know that i can't give up. i can't allow
others to get the best of me while constantly dwelling on my
misfortunes. in addition, i've also had the opportunity to meet
some great girls on here.<br />
<br />
i might as well tell it straight up - i haven't had the privilege
of many friends or much of a social life since college, but i do
have a few good friends who stick by me. but even through such a
shortcoming, i continue to enjoy life and seek out its many
adventures. and hey, if you're the type of person who frowns or
scoffs upon that, then please get off this profile - you've just
proved to me you weren't worth dating in the first place.<br />
<br />
if you've gotten this far in my profile, by the way, i appreciate
the interest :) so moving on, what am i looking for in a girl? i
need someone with a warm and sincere heart who will support and
have faith in me. this might come as a surprise from what i've
written here so far, but i do have a wacky sense of humor, so i
need someone who i can share that with. i'm not on here for
one-night stands or short-term relationships - i'm not even sure
why anyone plans for a short-term relationship in the first place.
it's like working towards a goal with the intention of already
failing. to me, a relationship is a journey you share with someone
filled with inevitable obstacles - what really matters in the end,
is whether you're both capable of overcoming and learning from
those obstacles together. i'm someone who treats every relationship
as if it were my final one, but make no mistake - i'm not an
idealist - i can't guarantee things will work out for good, but
what i can guarantee, is that i tried my best while it
lasted.<br />
<br />
so if i messaged you, know that i did read your entire profile and
that my message wasn't just something i spontaneously wrote while
leaving the front door. anyways, thanks for making it this far in
my profile and hopefully i can hear from you soon :)","i graduated from usc with a masters degree in structural
engineering and am currently working as a bridge engineer for a
consulting firm. let's be real though - sure, it can be exciting at
times seeing your bridge actually being constructed; sounding all
professional and highly-esteemed to your typical gossipy asian
parents; the pay is also great, but most of the time you're at a
desk cranking out calculations, examining shop drawings, and
running computer analyses endless times, that the work really does
get dull sometimes.<br />
<br />
if i didn't have to worry about financial burdens, what would my
dream job ultimately be? a filmmaker and consider that my personal
rebellion from the asian stereotype lol. i'm no lawyer, doctor, or
accountant. that's right, i'm a part-time writer and director for
my own film studio and i love doing it. maybe it's partly because
i'm a left-hander, so i am creatively dominant :)<br />
<br />
as for free time, i like to keep myself active while constantly
expanding my knowledge. i try to hit the gym three times week and
occasionally go for a run around my neighborhood. on my quieter

films, or grab dinner with my best friend. you're not going to find

type of lifestyle.","people tell me i'm a good conversationalist - i wouldn't know

goes!<br />
i just graduated from sfsu and am originally from the la area. my
degree is in communications and i consider myself pretty
self-aware. i just landed my first job out of college, and work in
high tech sales. while i am having a great time finding myself in
the ""real world' of employment, i do miss sleeping in!<br />
<br />
when not sleeping in (which is not very often), i love to keep busy
with friends and the outdoors. i enjoy exploring the city, finding
new eateries, coffee shops, wine bars, street fairs, shopping,
listening to and discovering new music, people watching in the park
(not in a creepy way, people are just way too entertaining when
they don't think anyone is looking!) and traveling. hopefully you
can tell at this point that i like to be active!<br />
<br />
now that i have provided a little self-summary about me, i will
provide some insight into who i am looking to meet. i'm looking for
a down to earth, normal guy. i know, i know... easier said than
done! i want someone who will explore the city with me, make me
laugh, inspire and challenge me, and grow with me as a
person.<br />
i want someone with positive energy who enjoys drinks at a bar and
also a bottle of wine at the house. i want someone to meet me
half-way and feel like they are also ""the lucky one"" in the
relationship. i want it all!!<br />

cooked at a luxury hotel in dublin, and one of the top restaurants

holed up in a submarine-like kitchen in the soho district, which
required me to open a hatch on the sidewalk and climb down a ladder
to access. i suppose they removed the periscope at some point,
although it certainly would have come in handy. and working side by
side with some surly, albeit very talented brits. a great
experience, but as the british might say, ""can't be bothered"" to do
80 hour weeks ever again.<br />

i'm now cooking at a restaurant which, if you keep up with the

i developed quite a passion for travel photography whilst in
europe, and have dabbled with food photography and portraiture. if
i find you worthy, i might even give you a gift of a photoshoot.
i've only ever done that once for someone. too time consuming, with
all the editing involved.<br />

have a darker side of humor, but take life totally in stride and
always try to find some positive.<br />

what might life with me be like? two weekends ago, a group of my
friends and i filled up some picnic baskets full of goodies and
headed out to a local winery. after purchasing a few bottles, we
laid out a spread in the patio area and relaxed and enjoyed the
sunshine.<br />

last weekend i went wandering around the city, acting like a
tourist and reconnecting with some places i hadn't been to in
awhile.<br />

there are some trails around me that i like to hike, especially if
the weather is good. i'm a decent skier although i don't get into

occasional show now and then. i prefer to spend time writing,
practicing my piano, and this may come as a surprise but i am a

and just kept on doing.<br />

many different parts of the country, including albuquerque,
houston, tampa and rochester ny. i've crossed the country 5 times,
and wouldn't mind doing it for a 6th.<br />

like to think of myself as the personality lovechild of liz lemon
from <em>30 rock</em> and michael cera's character in
<em>superbad</em>, but part of me just wants to be betty draper. my
first girl crush was miss manners, my most recent is kristen
stewart (don't judge!). my superhero alter ego is turquoise jeep
records superstar yung humma.<br />
<br />
i'm kind of a socially incompetent dorkwad a lot of the time,
mostly because i'm shy. i get excited in my metaphorical pants over
history trivia, and super juiced over anything to do with books.

exponentially more attractive. sometimes i pretend to be a
chameleon. more frequently i pretend to be a dinosaur.<br />

my nails are always painted, i'm usually in heels, i wear skirts
and dresses almost exclusively, and i rock brightly-colored
lipstick on a regular basis. i view it simultaneously as
performing/queering gender and as a genuine expression of my

i'm a big fan of speculative fiction and fantasy. i spent pretty
much the entirety of my preteen years coveting my copy of the lord
of the rings like it was the one ring and i was (a slightly less
hideous and awkward version of) gollum. however, harry potter was,
is, and always will be my one true love. i'm also vastly
appreciative of sheri tepper, octavia butler, and neil gaiman, and
i think the phantom tollbooth is probably one of the greatest books
ever written.<br />

movies:<br />
i watch singing in the rain whenever i'm sick. aside from that, i'm
a sucker for disney movies and nineteenth century period

anything within those parameters. except cilantro. that shit is my
kryptonite.","","the rules of killer bunnies, what kind of dinosaur i would be,

about me: moving to sf after slowly migrating up the peninsula the
past four years. if you ask my friends, they'd say that i'm an
enthusiastic planner of events combined with good follow through,
and a searcher of new experiences. on the hobbies front, i'm a jack
of all trades (with a decent bar of competency). currently:
climbing, cycling, snowboarding, pulling out old piano books (ugh),
cooking out of the ad hoc, momofuku and alinea cookbooks, and
channeling sytycd (hip hop and house dance classes). taking yoga
classes to stretch from the other activities!<br />
<br />
about you: physically active, smart and witty, appreciative of the
high arts but also enjoys pop culture, willing to try new things
(food, music, dance). daring enough to meet up for an eclectic
conversation that could cover canyoneering and waterfall hikes,
african dictators, ghibli anime, robert browning, joss whedon,
david chang, aung sang suu kyi, or dwell/outside magazine articles.
who knows??<br />
<br />
random facts/observations:<br />
<br />
sxsw was more enjoyable when it was more music festival and less a
zoo. (uggh i just sounded like a gramps).<br />
<br />
i've driven 210 km/hr in a friend's bmw in italy and then realized
it wasn't the autobahn and there were speed limits. (yet sf traffic
doesn't wear me down, it's a chance to catch up on music/npr)<br />
<br />
i've won two dance contests at weddings. think about that. how many
weddings have dance contests??? then think if skill would really
matter (hah!).<br />
<br />
my college graduation gift to my sister was a summit climb of the
grand teton. of course, i went along!<br />
<br />
my parents are happily married and still travel extensively (greece
and israel last year and they road tripped up to crater lake and
shasta when they came to visit me). something to emulate!<br />
<br />
i love using parentheticals (if you haven't noticed).","working in the corporate world but in a field that might make the
world a better place. also planning my next few trips (too many
options).<br />
<br />
i've done the daring ""quit my job, sold my house"" to backpack south
america and wyoming. loved it but it's out of my system (the
dropping everything part--the traveling part still exists).<br />
<br />
past year: going to dynamic events like concerts (prince, arcade
fire, mgmt, u2, vienna teng), opera (die walkure, cyrano), symphony
(carmina burana, mahler) to be in awe of people's talents. hmmm
what's the corollary when i go to a museum to observe art--a static
event?? (tate modern). recent shows were the bridge school benefit
(marcus mumford and dave matthews covering all along the
watchtower--ridiculous) and the operas xerxes and carmen.","(a) throwing a forehand flick (ex ultimate player)<br />
(b) being an accommodating traveler<br />
(c) hitting the deck while digging/setting in volleyball or while
playing shortstop in softball (hence the torn acls)<br />
<br />
pretty dang mediocre (but i stick with it) at<br />
road biking, rock-climbing, yoga, cooking, snowboarding<br />
<br />
and i'm even worse at jogging and swimming but since everyone seems
to do a tri around here, i've joined the lemmings.","who knows......but i've been approached in london, caen, arequipa,
munich and florence and been asked for directions. i'm going to go
out on a limb by stating i don't look like a local. maybe being a
liberal abc texan who actually smiles at folks is anomalous enough

sashimi fanatic that loves comfort foods (pho, dim sum, fish 'n
chips, texas bbq, spatzel). i got the ad hoc cookbook and even that
comfort food isn't that easy to make (damn you thomas
keller!).<br />
<br />
i've read around 55 books on the bbc list (guess i'm more fond of
watership down and the hobbit than the austen/hardy stuff but still
surprised by the number--i think being stuck overseas in 3rd grade
with the only english books being the classics really inflated the
number). a little behind the curve, but working through murakami
right now.<br />
<br />
did my senior thesis on film. yep, great excuse to view ""serious""
and lowbrow vietnam war movies for a grade.<br />
<br />
music--be prepare to *yawn*, i like wagner (really!). the
aforementioned die walkure--4.5 hours but awesome!<br />
<br />
i (sadly?) listen to a lot of 80s music (it's cameo's word up not
korn's). that's why the prince concert was awesome--played all his
oldies and u2 wasn't too shabby (but arcade fire dwarfed them
both). missed the naked and famous show at the independent in
december but caught them at the warfield a few weeks back (fun
show!).","(1) great friends<br />

that's it. you don't have to bring anything, you don't even have to
do the dishes. and since this is okcupid, i just want to clarify,
you will not be expected to suck my balls or anything else when
we're done. i mean, if you really wanted to because i'm that good
of a cook i'm not going to stop you, but a simple, ""damn, that shit
was deelish!"" will suffice as well.<br />
<br />
oh, you should also know that i'm just so-so in the kitchen. if i
somehow ruin dinner i will politely apologize and promptly order a
pizza. also, bacon will not be in every meal because i usually eat
it all during breakfast.<br />

actually, the problem is that i think too much. basketball,
politics, music, even management theory  i get lost in thought
over all kinds of subjects.<br />
<br />
i also get lost in cycling. i've been doing it two times a week for
about eight years. i like to cycle up san bruno mountain and back;
sometimes i'll go across the golden gate bridge across to marin.
it's an activity where i get to test myself and try to obtain a new
goal each time.<br />

i like a challenge. i joined toastmasters to get over my fear of
public speaking and now i love it so much that i even compete. it
also helps with presentations i do for work (i'm with the feds).

people. i strive to keep an open mind, learn as much as possible,
not to take myself too seriously, and have fun.<br />
<br />
i straddle the line between extrovert and introvert. sometimes i'm
really outgoing but at other times i simply enjoy having a one on
one conversation or reading a good book. my sense of humor is all
over the place - in that i find most of life to be
ridiculous/hilarious. i like to think i am witty but that is
probably up to you to decide.","i am a game designer at one of the companies in the redwood shores

i also own a mobile game company with my brother where i likewise
design our games in addition to creating the sounds, music, and
some programming.<br />
<br />
outside of work i mostly just try and have fun. lately, i've gotten
into creating music (on le computer), playing tennis, and trail
running but i also enjoy going to the city and exploring. i'm
always down to visit museums, hit up a bar, or go to a sick show.","i'm a hella good cook. and baker. i like making food for/with other

the time and you probably should too.<br />
<br />
i like movies and shows that disregard cliches. i hate it when i
can guess what is going to happen after the first 5 minutes. on the
flip side i also enjoy pretty much all martial arts movies, the
worse the dubbing the better. some of my favorite movies are
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, hot fuzz, children of men,
and princess mononoke. with shows i usually gravitate towards
comedy: it's always sunny, seinfeld, game of thrones are all

exploring national parks and the like, astronomy, museums, theater,
and lots of other stuff<br />
* grew up in alaska ... so i know how to treat hypothermia if you
need someone to warm you back up<br />
* love all kinds of animals; owner of a really cool cat<br />
* been out since 1984! family is supportive.<br />
* i've never had a psycho boyfriend who left me broken, jaded, and
mistrustful of relationships.<br />
* i have only ever been clean-shaven face for a handful of brief
periods in my adult life.<br />
* i look awful with a military/shaved haircut. i just don't have

the walking dead (show) is the worst show ever made. i can't stop

for those of you who have read the comic, i cannot wait to see what
they do with the governor. i really hope they don't just leave him

cable and deadpool (comic) is hilarious. what the fuck, deadpool.
seriously. also cable is badass.<br />

i found this series called the sixth gun (comic) a while ago, and
it has apparently gained so much of a following that they're making
a tv mini series. the only reason i don't like this series better
than the walking dead is because there are only like 16 issues so
far.<br />
<br />
wanted (comic) was legit. the movie had nothing to do with it.
super villains got together and wiped out all the super heroes. and
then they went to parallel universes to kill super heroes for fun.

with the inclusion of david tennant (sexy). he was both hilarious
and sexy in a way that everyone could understand. did i mention he
was sexy? anyway, the creators and shit saw it was getting big and
decided they could make a ton of money off the show. i think the
doctor just accidentally got his companion pregnant while her
husband was traveling with them. no idea how that would have
happened. to make it worse, i'm pretty sure the doctor ends up
marrying that kid. i don't even know why i watch it any
more....<br />

i haven't watched pokemon (show) in like........a couple months. i
should watch that some more....<br />
<br />
dragon ball z (anime) was so awesome to watch from start to finish.
my god it's awesome high.<br />
<br />
the boondocks (show) is probably the greatest show ever.<br />
<br />
breaking bad (show) is the perfect series. it is as addictive as
the substance they make.<br />
<br />
eminem's (music) discography is the most fascinating biography i've
ever heard.<br />
<br />
electric six (music) is full of awesome. this fact cannot be
refuted for it is written in the laws of physics.<br />
<br />
everyone likes daft punk (music). tell me someone who doesn't like
daft punk.<br />
<br />
aesop rock (music) is pretty sweet. it's funny because he's white,
and the other rapper i listen to is eminem. i laughed when i found
out he was white. sounded black to me.<br />

i've been listening to the snoop dog (music) pandora station for a

<br />
dr. dre (music) is on that station and signed eminem, so he is
obviously amazing as well.<br />

i didn't know how awesome 2pac (music) was until that snoop
station. crazy, right?<br />
<br />
same deal with biggie (music) as 2pac. weird shit. these are great

don't listen to a lot of old music like him often, but it's mostly
better music than i usually listen to.<br />

i am unique, spiritual, and intelligent. there is no reason to
judge the book by its cover (regardless of how many times its said,
its true). what's so wrong about a nice conversation, regardless of
setting or action being taken place?? yes there is a time and place
for everything, but why not mix it up a little bit and learn while
learning is deemed not possible by normal means.<br />

styles of dance. i have insomnia.<br />
<br />
i get along with people. i don't judge them. i like having friends
who have other perspectives as long as they are as willing to
listen as i am.<br />
<br />
i am mixed race, and i move between many communities. i don't
identify as anything. i have tried, but it feels like a lie. well,
i identify as a person, but that's about it. issues around gender
roles press my buttons. i like opening doors for people and
impressing them with my ability to lift really heavy shit.<br />
<br />
if i witness a conflict between strangers in public, and i'm not
putting myself in danger, i will step in and try to defuse
it.<br />
<br />
i'm a very versatile actor. i'm good at physical comedy. i can also
be shy.<br />
i often feel like running away. i like trying new things and going
places i've never been.<br />
<br />
i love to be touched and massaged. i love playing games- not the
emotional kind- theater games and non-competitive group games. i
appreciate word-play.<br />
<br />
i love adventures- big and small.<br />
i'm good at finding things to do in cities. i also love being out
in the wild.<br />
i listen to a lot of public radio.<br />
i love sarcasm, but i hate meanness.","i work as an actor, and i teach dance and theater to kids and
adults. lately i've been working as a director/choreographer.
sometimes i play the concertina, which is like a cute little
accordion.<br />
<br />
i own a big house, which recently inherited from my mother, and i
populate it with wonderful artist-friends. i am married to my best
friend in the world. he's a man. that makes me bi, but i'm usually
attracted to women.<br />
<br />
i couple years ago i spent 6 months in paris, studying french. i
love speaking french, but i temporarily shelved it to learn a
little portuguese before going to brazil. i just got back from
brazil, where i was teaching dance in a small town, and i'm not
sure i can still speak french. oh well.<br />
<br />
i am often rehearsing for a show. that means there are times when
i'm busy every night and can't hang with friends.","dance and movement of many kinds, acting, putting up shelves,
saying ""yes"" to suggestions, finding my way in unfamiliar places,
finding joy, being hard on myself, listening, seeing things from
multiple perspectives, adapting to given circumstances,
choreography, crafts, algebra, running barefoot","my big hair.<br />
unless it's pulled back that day. if it is, they can't find me.","i have a hard time when people ask me what my favorite is. here is
me trying to answer this question:<br />
<br />
favorite smell: jasmine bushes, sauteing garlic<br />
<br />
favorite radio programs/ podcasts: radio lab, this american life,
the moth, snap judgement, risk!, wtf<br />
<br />
i love books and movies. i like so many, and don't currently feel i
have any favorites. in my early 20s, my 2 favorite novels, hands
down, were 'sexing the cherry' by jeanette winterson and 'their
eyes were watching god' by zora neale hurston. i love going to
movies by myself in the middle of the day.<br />
<br />
music: funk is necessary. i listen to big band, klezmer, tango,
ragtime, circus music, punk, funk, r&amp;b, jazz, blues, rock, rap,
reggaeton, dancehall, hip hop, african, carribean, bangra, salsa,
anything with an accordian, a cappella, classical, middle eastern,
so much more. i have a special place in my heart for sweet honey in
the rock and stevie wonder.<br />
<br />
food: i love to eat. i eat everything, though i was a vegetarian
for many years. i have a high spice tolerance, but i also
appreciate subtle flavors. i cook almost every day.","not attached to things","what i'm doing with my life,<br />

to college in michigan and then came back because my idea of
planning for post-grad life was going to football games and
throwing dinner parties in my apartment. hey, they seemed supremely
important at the time. anyway, so here i am. i work in education at
the moment. i still from time to time lament my untapped musical
genius that i have long dreamed of using to become the world's
greatest rock star. ok, so fundraising isn't my dream job, but it
keeps my savings account pretty happy.<br />
<br />
i like to do firsts and move fast on fast-moving vehicles. i find
intelligence a huge turn-on, along with a sense of humor. laughing
is among my favorite things to do, so that's important. i'm also
not one of those girls who wants you to pretend that you don't like
me and be all aloof. as long as i don't see you peering into my
bedroom window on any occasion ever, feel free to show interest. i
also like a little quirkiness and i really like people who make me
think.<br />
<br />
further short favorite things list: candle light, fog, rain, going
on midnight walks in the neighborhood, being challenged...bah, i'm
too tired for this right now, i'll finish the list later! in the
meantime, try to get comfortable on the edge of your seat.","i don't know! i tend to go to work sometimes and get things done on
occasion. i'm living in san francisco but would be open to moving
on a whim. i graduated from university of michigan several years
ago and have thought about graduate school but can't seem to decide
what i would do when i got there or even after. that

know it.","ordering the best thing on almost any menu; being completely in
control driving while convincing everyone in my car that i am
completely out of control (this takes seriou skill); being goofy;
being an unofficial (and certainly unpaid and sometimes unwilling)
therapist for friends and strangers; drawing facial profiles;
making kids think i am the coolest person on the planet; throwing
things.","my smile and my voice.","books: among my all-time favorite books: slaughterhouse five,
anything by wilde or emerson, a tale of two cities, the alchemist,
and a frick-ton of others. thanks to a very good high school friend
of mine, i have also discovered the beauty of comic books aka
graphic novels.<br />
<br />
movies: i love movies and there is just no way i can choose
favorites!<br />
<br />
tv: i watch a lot of jon stewart, i like new girl and 30 rock and
parks &amp; rec and those kinds of shows. i like criminal minds and
planet earth and so you think you can dance (not to be confused
with dancing with the stars, which is just pretty awful). i used to
watch mystery science theater 3000 back when it was on and also
buffy. there are a ton of shows people keep telling me i need to
watch and the thought of catching up on all of them is terribly
daunting.<br />
<br />
food: also hard to narrow down. all i can say is i love spicy food
and well mostly anything.<br />

still go completely bananas every time ""live your life"" comes on at

ubergeeked by those she surrounds herself with. a hopeless
optimist, i revel in building strong friendships and relationships.
i'm affectionate, flirtatious, independent, supportive, and active.
i'm stubborn and opinionated, but have an open mind. i'm sweet and
gentle, but love hitting hard in roller derby. perhaps i'm a
walking contradiction.<br />
<br />
i'm a derby girl, and am still in awe of what i'm capable of
through determination and passion. the sport is teaching me much
about myself and my abilities, and keeping me constantly striving
to get better. i love it, and it has proven to be the best way to
keep myself active at the level i've always wanted to keep engaged
in. during the week, my days are spent as a project manager at a
""startup"" software company which is making some serious waves in
the procurement field. i'm enthused about having a job that
challenges me and keeps me on my toes, in an environment that's
encouraging and fast-paced. i'm a geographer, with a passion for
gis, conservation, caves, cartography, and visualization. i'm an
artist who loves making things with her hands and eyes.<br />
<br />
i am snuggly, gregarious, and optimistic.","enjoying it, most of all. i play roller derby, so i skate hard,
turn left, and play my heart out. i have an exciting new job, so
i'm pushing myself to do great while trying to maintain a balance
in my life. recently, i've worked a series of short term jobs,
where i made those good impressions and gained valuable experience
which helped me get to where i am now. i'm a wayward grad student,
studying gis (geography). i have too many hobbies that i circulate
through as i get distracted (currently focusing on jewelry-making,
knitting, photography, hiking, and geocaching). trying to find
enough time for the beautiful relationships i already have (both
with sweeties and friends) and continuing to cultivate those and
new friendships.<br />

""helping people waste time on the internet"". now i work on electric
cars.<br />
<br />
i rock climb like some people ski (every possible moment when the
weather is good). recently, i climbed steck-salath in yosemite and
levitation 29 in red rocks. this coming season i'd like to do some
big walls and finally finish the rostrum, among other things.<br />
<br />
once upon a time, i wanted to get an mfa in photography.","remembering things that don't need remembering. rock climbing.
photography. writing code. things that involve manual dexterity.","i have long arms.","fiction: i recently read two excellent debut novels: the quantum
thief by hannu rajaniemi, and liminal states by zack parsons. i'm
about halfway through wildwood by colin meloy. i've read all of the
song of ice and fire (a.k.a. game of thrones) books, think that the
hunger games trilogy goes downhill after the first book, and read
an embarrassing number of laurell k. hamilton books before i
realized that they had turned entirely into bodice-ripping
fanservice.<br />
<br />
non-fiction: lately i've found myself reading a lot of books about
the cultural impact of technology, mostly video games (tom bissell,
jane mcgonigal, harold goldberg, steven johnson, the new collection
of william gibson articles). i'm also technically re-reading susan
sontag's on photography, but let's just say that progress is
slow.<br />
<br />
music: i mostly listen to music like: <a class=""ilink"" href=

photography: i love the 60's moma school of photography (robert
frank, lee friedlander, garry winogrand, william eggleston, etc).
the americans is one of my favorites. i also like eugne atget. as
for contemporary photographers, nikki s. lee does some really
interesting work.<br />
<br />
tv: i try to keep up with: 30 rock, archer, being human, bones,
castle, downton abbey, house, parks and recreation, portlandia.
past favorites include: bsg, firefly, veronica mars.<br />
<br />
food: one of the reasons i love living in this city is the
availability of high-quality food, high-class to hole-in-the-wall.
i only wish i had more opportunities to discover new eats.<br />
<br />
games: recent favorites include: bioshock, spacechem, civilization
5, skyrim, arkham city, and the mass effect and dead space series.

understand a lot of the stuff coming out of japan these days.","camera, film, friends, laptop, headphones, good food","weird, completely irrational things. what if you could bring

just so thoughtful. i wish everyone i encountered was like this. i
mean, maybe if that one dude selling the street sheet on 16th

asked me how i was doing before he made his sales pitch, i'd just
might pony up that dollar. selfless people like that are so rare

ahead in the corporate world. or else you'll end up with a shitty
job like working at a call-center.<br />

three months ago. and that 6'10'' guy kept begging me to cum on his
wife's tits. that was just so cold and inhospitable, man. maybe if
they asked about my hobbies, learned i enjoyed whittling and doing
crossword puzzles in bed, i could have done something for him. or
that asian couple fucking on the sofa next to me. no hi. no how
are you? it was straight to suck on my tits. and all anyone did
was stare at my cock. i mean, hello, lift your eyes! there's a

everyone's just so darn pushy. like those chirpy greenpeace
volunteers who stop me on the street. you know the ones -- they're

gentlemen....i am not interested in polyamory.... i just had picked
the name pollyanna because i'm a really positive thinking person,

pollyasaurus, and now i can't change the name unless i start a

and you guys will just have to get over yourselves","getting back to my own creative life after being in a ltr for many
years where i focused a lot of my time and energy on making a home,
garden, flipping property, building a future with my spouse and
family.....re-shifting more back into my art life and career and
meeting new people as well as spending time with long term friends,
family, and community. never tried dating this way, but seems to be
the way to meet more new people...........","noticing all the details, making stuff, gardening, cooking,
painting, doing creative things, telling the truth to a fault","i seem to get attention for being pretty, my bubbly personality,
that i'm smart; depends on the person......most people assume i'm
younger than i am based on my looks and energy level. my spouse was
younger than me, not necessarily uncommon for me since i'm
energetic and youthful and it fits.","you could take up the whole page here if you really answered this
in detail....i listen to audio books a lot. right now i'm listening
to dave eggars, a heartbreaking work of staggering genius. one of
my favorite authors is kate braverman, i love everything is
illuminated, housekeeping (the book and the movie), she's come
undone, the lovely bones, a dangerous woman, white oleander,
running with scissors, david sedaris, a simple plan, spaulding gray
(bummed that he is gone, he was a genius), i love movies although
haven't watched too many this last year; i like independent films a
lot. two of my favorite films were an angel at my table and
housekeeping, guess that's because i'm a closet writer at heart.
not really into musicals unless it includes doing the time warp, or
the wall, stuff like that. i like all different kinds of music,
love vocalists, saxophone...like to dance, especially if it's some
funk or blues. i like lots of different kinds of food, and can make
a lot of it, too. i like to grow a lot of my own fruit and
vegetables. produce that fresh tastes so much better than anything
you can buy. i'm a bit of a health nut, and a foodie at times. i
make everything from scratch usually.","only six? but i like so many things.....hmmm....my daughter and ze
munchkins, all the things i love to do, make, be....beauty, beauty,
everywhere, people and their life stories, all the beautiful juicy
colors, cats, plants growing, warm sun, warm water, music, books,
community, dancing with total abandon, wanton sensuality,
visibility for 100 feet so i can watch the cuttle fish change
colors....","what i'm making next, what i want to achieve...........i am always
making lists and then doing the steps it takes to accomplish what i
want for myself. i like that about myself, that i know how to do
what i imagine for myself, to manifest what i want. i like
networking with others and like other creatives which is probably
why i have known so many amazing and talented people in my life. i
also think a lot about friends, family, the people and community i
care about; how to keep a balance in all the areas of my

yes, i enjoy quoting stupid movies. yes, i think it's a completely
appropriate first impression. disagree? no worries, stick me with a
poor rating and move onto the next candidate who'd rather give you
his resume, list his accomplishments, and hope you see that picture
of him in his shiny ride. personally, i'd say this is the time for
candor about who i am and what i'm looking for... so there you are,
me in a nutshell. if we can't laugh together, we could never be in
eachother's lives, at least not intimately. you would tire of my
never ending shenanigans - my goofatude would wear on your frail
nerves, and frankly, i would get bored and begin chewing on the
legs of the antique coffee table your grandmother gave you;
digging; barking incessantly. let's not allow that to happen.<br />
<br />
phew okay, with that off my chest, let me say that i can absolutely
be serious, not to worry. i am a professional. period. i work from
home, have the discipline to be successful in such an environment,
and love the time that it gives me to focus on the things that make
me smile. what are those things? anything outdoors and physical. i
am a crossfit fanatic - i gave up on the globo-gyms of the world
long ago. keep it fresh, and intensely difficult, and i'm a happy
man. recent back surgery brought me back down to earth for a bit,
but i'm back baby! yes, i did just use the word ""back"" three times
in the same sentence. but that's what life is about, i've learned -
take the good with the bad and move on... and use healthy number of
cliches when describing your self to strangers.<br />
<br />
i am a die hard giants fan; 2010 was magical - and not just because
krup and kuip said so. the niners hold a special place in my heart
as well... sadly that place is currently filled with the tears of
kittens, and tinkerbell's nightmares. it's tough to be a niner fan,
and it doesn't look like this year will be much better. i will cry
at some point this season. what!? you said you wanted a man who was
willing to express himself! can't have it both ways. [update: i
wrote this before the season started... i won't say more b/c i
don't want to jinx them - go niners! ** new update: yes, i cried. i
now officially hate the nyg. but i'm grateful for the nfc
championship, and am trying my best to remain positive for next
year's prospects].<br />
my idea of the perfect sunday is waking up early, running around
the lagunitas and bon tempe lakes in marin, coming home, and
resting my derriere comfortably in front of the tube to soak up a
full day of football. and yes ladies, if that doesn't do it for
you, i am also a card-carrying fantasy football nerd to boot - hot,
right!?<br />
<br />
family. it's small - i mean my family, get your mind of out the
gutter, please - but they mean the world to me. i was raised by my
mother and two grandmothers, and cherish the influence these women
have had on my life. i am forever grateful!<br />
<br />
as for what i'm looking for, i'm hoping its obvious. someone who is
active and fun; someone to share the outdoors with; someone who
agrees that laughter is the key to a solid relationship; it must be
present, it must be hearty, it must not sound like a donkey. i have
a puppy, so being a dog-person is non-negotiable. if you don't like
puppies, there is something fundamentally wrong with you. i mean
that in the most endearing way i assure you, but please, don't
bother. other than that, surprise me. i'm up for just about
anything!","","","","books: the prophet, the passage, ender's game, hitchhickers guide

<br />
awesome at organic gardening.<br />
<br />
oh! <a class=""plink"" href=""/profile/fotoshopgirl"">fotoshopgirl</a>
and i work on a bunch of lovely photography projects together. she
is exceptionally talented. if you want your picture taken, and can
fake a pose, you should let me know. maybe you can be in our next
project.<br />
<br />
the skyline was beautiful on fire, all twisted metal stretching
upwards, everything washed in a thin orange haze. i said, ""kiss me,
you're beautiful, these are truly the last days"". you grabbed my
hand and we fell into it. like a daydream or a fever.","i'm finishing up a phd in computer science at berkeley. computer
security. hacker, turned researcher, turned umm hacker. i write
programs to analyze other programs for vulnerabilities. p|-|34r
|v|3. like omg, just have to finish my dissertation. i don't know
what that means. or what's real. that's right, dr steve. doctor of
nothing. le docteur de rien. but that is a good title.<br />
<br />
i have a job now, i really just need to get a staple through these
papers and call this dissertation done.<br />
<br />
i rock climb, cook, hike, garden and take photographs, sometimes at
the same time! life goals include acquiring as many awesome skills
as possible. i am ultrapassionate and detailed about everything i
love. i have been known to go into so much detail that eyes have
been known to glaze over. i contend that this is a good thing. if
you cannot be passionate, why be?<br />
<br />
i take pictures with a full frame camera. nikon d700 with a bunch
of primes and flashes and whathaveyou. you know if you care.<br />

<br />
listening. constantly improving.","making people feel valued, science, word games, arguing,
communication, being awesome, conversations, bong rips (faux
pas!)?, doing all the drugs, living fast, dying young, leaving a
beautiful corpse, etc. not making lists.","depending on the time, you may notice my loud voice as i may be
arguing loudly about some detail of my research, or i may smell
like cannabis. turns out, you can do both at the same time!<br />
<br />
but yeah, most noticeable would be that i am wearing a bright
colored hoodie under a tweed jacket with some outlandish glasses on
most days of the week.<br />
<br />
i am introverted and spend a lot of time thinking about what i say
before i engage someone. but i go from quiet to overbearing after a
bottle of wine. but i am always right. or pretend to be. or concede
when i am wrong.<br />
<br />
i am annoyingly accurate with my ability to argue and reason, and
stand upon my ivory tower of being correct and give birth to it. or
not, whatever. turns out, if you can keep up, say hello.","i am a total bibliophile, but my kindle has replaced most of that.

7. camera<br />
8. laughter<br />
9. your mom (if you're counting, this is the second your mom joke i
have made, it's like an easter egg!)<br />
10. music. yeah, blah blah blah, i listened to them when they were
that,but not that, especially not my style. but i did listen to
them when they were all that. and remembered to ignore later, not
now though, they lost all of their that and replaced it with
ridiculousness. you know? if not, please, do not message me. we
already exist on different planes of existence and this would only
make it more difficult to relate. i have no idea what i am talking
about and i also have everything in mind what i am talking about, i
am not ambiguous but i don't often make sense and compromising
ideas seems like a lame way out. mostly, i just decided to ramble
for a while. abandon hope all ye who message me.<br />
11. turning it up to eleven.<br />
1*2^2*3. finding prime factorizations. really. it passes the time.","1) interesting and complex problems. lame, but really, yes, mental
capacity is largely assigned to this.<br />
2) myself and interactions with others. introversion is
magical.<br />
3) sex. pushing boundaries is explorative and fun. so much fun. i
kiss like a girl.<br />
4) cannabis. you don't care nor know as much as i do no matter how
much you think that you do, with extremely, exceptionally high
probability. pretentious and presumptuous? perhaps, incorrect,
no.<br />
5) contentedness. elusive, it is.<br />
6) communication. because transcending beyond passive aggressive
behavior and latent behavior is umm, awesome. because i like,
cannot read your mind duuude.<br />
7) cuddling. because touch is just as important as verbal
communication. god i love cuddling. seriously, i can be either
spoon happily.<br />
8) group sleepovers. see 3, 4, 6, 7. i bet 5 people can fit in my
bed comfortably. just sayin.<br />

how if anyone is actually serious about astrology, i will first say
'how can it not be true if we're all made of stars?' lol. before i
ramble about how binning personalities and fates based on an
arbitrary partiton of months is just plain ridiculous. if you want
to try to convince me otherwise, let's like, totally do it man.","plotting irresponsibility. or following through with said
irresponsibility.<br />
<br />
perhaps thinking about your mother. i'm sorry, it's just that she's
over here so often, and it is hard not to mention her.<br />
<br />
when i have grown past my prime, i will no longer think these your
mom jokes are funny. end me then.","i am a total closet freak. the only reason i am posting this
publicly is that i know what i want. i love people, i love
connection. i am trans friendly but inexperienced with what that
means on an intimate level, but i am willing to explore.<br />
<br />
i try not to be too forward with these things, but a wise man once
said that you never get what you don't ask for. mostly, i am
awesome, emotionally magnanimous, humanistic, good at hugging and
far more modest than this profile would imply. i love living and i
love connection, but i am learning to ditch my shy sense of living
and just embrace moments as they occur.<br />
<br />
it feels insane pouring my emotions and ideas and wants and dreams
to strangers, but, why not, let's play. cuddle. play some more.
maybe a whole day.<br />
<br />

not looking for anything too serious for a while, but cultivating
relationships and sexy friends is exactly what is ideal right now.
i'm great at commitment, but that is not what i need in my life
right now. in fact, monogamous commitment kind of sounds ridiculous
at this point in my life. perhaps, ever. most likely, ever.
meaning, if you are not down with having multiple lovers, it
probably won't work out.<br />
<br />
i'm a ridiculously nice guy -- most of the time, much to my
chagrin, with a certain sense of tragedy. working on that. i'm not
nearly as arrogant or pretentious as this profile may impose. i'm
worse. no actually the exact opposite of that, with a side of dry
sense of humor. side of ur mom.<br />

improtant!: before i really know someone i'm kinda like a robot but
also funny. so if that scares you away then sorry. if that
interests you though. please read on.<br />
<br />
preface! this whole thing is just me analyzing myself. i have
trouble expressing my personality through text so rather than
express i can only really explain.<br />
<br />
ted talks are awesome. also this is relevant to my personality.
http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/temple_grandin_the_world_needs_all_kinds_of_minds.html<br />

<br />
i'm not a party person. i'm a homebody. this isn't because i'm
afraid of parties or anything. i'm just uncomfortable in large
groups of people where i don't know anybody. i need a companion to
help me brave the hoards of the unknown<br />
<br />
i'm an introvert.
http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/03/caring-for-your-introvert/2696/<br />

<br />
well for starters i don't capitalize on the internet. pointlessly
holding shift every couple of words is weird and illogical. there
are periods for a reason. if you asked me i honestly couldn't tell
you a good reason to capitalize the beginning of every
sentence.<br />
<br />
that'll do for now. it's a preface to the rest of the profile. so,
please read on weary web traveler.<br />
<br />
as a result of falling in the autistic spectrum i'm a bit ocd about
tactile stimuli. one time someone was referring to how you don't
feel your clothes all the time while you're wearing them and i was
like ""what are you talking about 0.o"" this makes me weird in a
couple ways. if you're curious then go ahead and ask.<br />
<br />
if you've seen the first episode of how i met your mother then you
can understand when i say that i identify a crap ton with what ted
says to robbin at the end of that episode about being terrible at
being single and all that.<br />
<br />
ooh here's something to add. i think i would be described as
chaotic good in dnd terms.<br />
<br />
another good thing to add. (i'm just putting these in here as they
come to mind) i will, for whatever reason, eventually have not much
to say over the internet. i am an in person personality. i can't
remember who said it but it's been said that all relationships are
based on shared experiences and texting over the internet doesn't
seem like much of an experience. so, if you think maybe you might
like to meet eventually then that's bonus points in my book.<br />
<br />
(edit. (  i'm running out of steam when it comes to
online interaction. i know it's almost a taboo in our culture to
meet someone from the internet after learning very little about
them but it's so much faster and more effective to just meetup.
assuming i were an evil person out to do bad things. i don't have
magic powers that make you come with me to a dangerous place or
anything like that. if we meet in person at a coffee shop there is
very little risk being run there. i say this because i am terrible
online. i'm bad at whatever it is you need to do to keep someone
interested. in person i'm much better. i'm a great deal more
experienced in face to face communication. body language is great
and tone+timing are what i rely on to actually be funny at all.
that being the key ingredient to the majority of human relations it
can be hard for me to make much of a connection through text. so
all that being said. if you'd like to meet in person please just
tell me. i wont get weird about it or be scared off. however if you
want to talk first that's fine too. just, i'm bad at reading
between the lines when there are actually lines of text to be read
between so if you're genuinely interested don't be afraid to be
blunt about it. in fact i'd prefer it.)<br />
<br />
i enjoy debate. i used to say arguing but people assume the wrong
thing. when i say arguing i'm referring to the dictionary
definition. no aggression or anything like that intended.<br />
<br />
i'm not really here to make new friends. i'm ok with making new
friends. that's just not why i'm here. making friends in person
seems to work out better anyway. i'm actually on this site because
my appearance and attitude in real life cause me to make an
inaccurate first impression. part of it seems to be that i look 16.
it runs in my family to look very young. this would be nice if i
were 40 but i'm just about 20 so it's really more of a detriment at
this point.<br />
<br />
i'm pretty bad at small talk. i'm good at big talk. or the deeper
things. philosophy is one of my biggest passions but most people
don't actually want to have a philosophical conversation. they'd
rather talk about the weather or sports or something equally safe
and easy to think about. i can small talk about a few things. video
games, movies, comics, art, technology or science. but that tends
to lead to bigger conversations. i can't just talk about how tron
legacy was mediocre, i end up getting into the moral implications
of mass ai murder and the scientific craziness that bringing an ai
program to life and somehow manifesting it a functioning humanoid
body would entail. that shit's crazy yo! also what the hell tron
writers? ""so tron is gonna be bad in this one! yeah! awesome!""
""alright well tron is a badass like an unquestionable badass. what
do we do to let the protagonist beat him?"" ""oh no man don't worry,
he'll have a change of heart. and it won't be tied to anything
particular in the story he'll just suddenly have the force of will
to overwrite his corrupt code and eff up the baddie. not a single
inconsistency there!""<br />
<br />
interesting thing. when something really sad or upsetting happens
to me. my first reaction is to laugh my ass off more than cry or
anything else. this has developed recently. dunno why.<br />
<br />
90% of the books i've read were written by english guys. as a
result i've got an unusual amount of brittish in my head. it's not
outwardly evident. just something about me.<br />
<br />
everyone seems to have one of these so my myers brigg thingy is
intj","working on becoming a 3d animator. maybe an illustrator. i just
like design and movement and 3d art. so anything in that area would
be great.","providing perspective. a lot of people say they're good at giving
advice. but i think that it's much more effective to provide as
much perspective and information as you can to a person. really
when you help people with their problems i think the best thing to
do is just help them think rather than helping them decide.<br />
<br />
video games, being honest, having proper arguments. not fights,
conversations with 2 opposing points of view.<br />
<br />
i'm also good at climbing things. don't know why but i've always
enjoyed climbing the typically unclimbed. stop lights for
example.<br />
<br />
it used to say art up at the top of this part but that doesn't
quite cover it. i spent my life from age 7 to age 17 extremely
focused on drawing specifically and art in general. so i'm really
good at that. proof's in the profile pictures.<br />
<br />
people have said i sound near exactly like micheal sera. though not
usually until someone brings it up. personally i can't hear it. but
it's my voice so...","i'm different. i act different. i look different. i think
differently. this puts a lot of people off. those few that it
doesn't bother seem to end up being the people i'm closest to in
life.","books by douglas adams. also terry pratchett. dude has like 30
books out and i've been reading them all one by one. i think i have
4 left.<br />
<br />
movies i'd say i love animation. but i also like sci fi. though the
recent sci fi sucks. i like anything with a really well
choreographed fight scene. also making fun of bad movies is plenty
of fun. or watching other people make fun of bad movies a la
rifftrax.<br />
<br />
breaking bad is the best show right now in my opinion<br />
for comedies you've got your 30 rocks and your communitys i learned
to absolutely love mash when i was a little insomniac kid who
watched tv all night because he couldn't sleep.<br />
<br />
prodigy, eminem, the kraken from the potc soundtrack lots
more.<br />
oooh but my favorite song ever is around the world by daft punk.
it's repetitive as hell and, as a result, actually kind of bad. but
it's beat matches both my heart rate and my steps when i'm walking
most places. as a result it feels like i have my own personal theme
song.<br />
<br />
i like mochi, caramel brownies, pizza, other stuff.<br />
<br />
i'm a media vacuum so i actually love all kinds of movies and music
and tv so i've narrowed these down to my most favorite of each
category.<br />
<br />
video games! i play them! they're awesome! other people should also
play them!","my computer<br />

<br />
the cooler people i know.<br />
<br />
anything my brain randomly decides is obsession worthy. like that
little bit of paint that's coming off the wall that i'll eventually
turn into a giant patch of missing paint, metaphorically
speaking.<br />
<br />
recently my friend helped me realize that i have a tunnel vision
approach to most of life. i do few things at a time but i do those
things with so much dedication, thought, and often times passion
that it makes it worth the sacrifice of whatever else i could have
been doing as well. recently i realized a good word for this is
fixation. i fixate. all the time. it's almost the only way i get
anything done.","hanging with my friends or working diligently on a project.<br />
<br />
i'm up for anything but my friends and i are mostly poor and we
like video games so we don't have reason to do other things.","anything. which sounds weird, but why? i don't have anything to
hide. and if you ask about anything i would think you'd be prepared
to hear the answer so it's not a social thing. what's the deal with
being all closed off and mysterious? those people kinda seem like
jerks to me.<br />
<br />
here's one that seems relevant though. i'm a very low grade, high
functioning autistic. as a result i don't have a lot of innate
understanding in regards to social interaction. i'm not socially
incompetent though i just go about social interaction differently
than other people. however it does present a problem for me. i
don't ""let loose"" because as an autistic my example of letting
loose involves a lot of staring at people and memorizing their
faces and then probably hugging/cuddling them.<br />
<br />
this isn't really private but it doesn't seem to be appropriate for
anywhere else. i guess i should say something about what i'm
looking for. a girl who doesn't hate video games and is willing to
wade through the awkward part before we really know each other.","you weren't scared away by my profile. seriously message me. why

amount of time growing up in europe, which provided me with a high
capacity for learning foreign languages and mathematics somehow. my
dad is a writer, and he finds his inspiration through his travels.
i was lucky enough to go along for the ride as a youngster.<br />
<br />
i sought a career in acting in la, after a successful stint in
musical theater in high school. i also spent many summers working
with my uncle behind the camera in hollywood before i decided to
move to la. it did not take long, however, for me to grow tired of
the industry, so instead, i earned a degree in classics &amp;
archaeology from a small jesuit school in west la.<br />
<br />
during this time, when i was 21, my dad took me to haiti, where my
grandfather was living and treating sick people, many with aids or
hiv. this trip changed my life, and i have been longing to return
for years. after college, i moved to sf to pursue a degree in
biochemistry, hoping that modern science will someday help me help
people who are suffering. i just graduated and i'm now in the
process of pursuing a career in the medical science field, while
trying not too much to suppress my passion for food, wine, and
great friendship.","i'm working part time at a great restaurant to pay for school and

be confused with an ambivalist or anarchist, though i've been known
to keep company with some). while i'd hope it would go without

east bay native, but not for lack of trying. i don't get out enough
to know whether or not i'm a stereotype or a hipster, and i don't
get why people my age spend so much time trying to undermine one
another's authenticity. i'm big on autonomy, very opposed to

matters and the <a href=""http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=reviews"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">roger ebert</a> side of cinema. also, i'm pretty
sure i'm a pomosexual. my body, though occasionally <a href=""http://www.sparklecock.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">metaphorical</a>, is
not a temple. i only own two pairs of shoes at a given time, but
compulsively hoard most other things.<br />
<br />
i don't know how to talk about myself without sounding like a
wanker; though i have surprising eloquence for someone with such

<br />
(ps: <em>i don't use okc's ""tagging"" feature; all these blue links
actually go to awesome things off-site.</em> my goal is to slowly
rebuild this profile entirely out of hyperlinks.)","when i'm not selling my time to our retail overlords, i like to
watch sci-fi, read non-fiction, and go on dates from the internet.
i'm prone to tinkering/crafting when there's nothing else going on,
or just binge-learning on the internet at two in the morning, with
two-dozen tabs open until my attention deficit tires itself out.
lately i've been doing nothing but programming in pd and soldering
the shit out of <a href=""http://www.getlofi.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">homebrew electronics</a>. if you know your way around
<a href=""http://puredata.info/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">graphical
programming interfaces</a>, or if you know how to program
microcontrollers, we need to hang out.<br />
also i smoke a lot, and drink coffee. it's awesome!<br />
during the summer months i come out of hibernation and climb rocks
and ride bikes and dress more tastefully. this whole ""living in the
motherfucking future"" thing has gotten me really optimistic lately,
and i'm having a great time.<br />
<br />
<strong>-advisories and disclaimers-</strong><br />
<br />
now might be a good time to mention i'm in an open relationship,
and i live at home with my partner. we're not polyamorous, per se,
so i'm not on here looking for anything too serious, just some sexy
fun times with people who i feel like i can relate to.<br />
if you like my style, but wish i didn't have this clumsy penis, you
might want to check my girl out instead at <a class=""plink"" href=
""/profile/awwwkwardturtle"">awwwkwardturtle</a>. she's a
looker!<br />
also, may i mention that if you don't say you're looking for casual
sex on your profile, don't expect me to make the first move. the
proverbial ball is in your court in that regard, because i don't
want to come off as a sleazebag or waste anyone's time. (you're
welcome.)<br />
whether our involvement is sexy, friendly, academic, or some
wonderful combination thereof, i should point out: i'm working six
day weeks right now, and hardly see the people i already know. you
have been warned, and i'll remove this warning as i secure more
adequate employment.","graphic design, climbing rocks, bass guitar, electronics, witty
banter, investment banking, mosh pits, oral, making useless pretty
art objects, and sleeping until noon.<br />
<br />
yeah, that just about sums it up... as for the rest of life, i'm
only mildly good at it, and some things i really suck at. hmm...
should i list them? oh why not:<br />
<br />
i really suck at:<br />
cooking, shaving my face parts, gambling, modern technology,
ghost-riding the whip, dancing, and wearing sweaters.<br />
<br />

(my hobbies include shameless self-promotion, lawl)","it took me a while to figure this one out, but apparently i have an
accent. not a proper one, like someone from a foreign country would
have, but rather a strange combination of dialects all fighting it
out at once. it's not predictably rhotic or non-rhotic,
grammatically inconsistent in tense, very professional in tone (if
you overlook the <a href=""http://youtu.be/zbey46hdj6a"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">constant foul language</a>), and i will verb nouns and
otherwise conjugate the shit out of anything put in front of me. i
also refuse to accept the gender-specificity of virtually anything;
i.e. ""bro"", ""blowjob"", ""floozie"". (this is either awkward or
awesome, depending on how you relate to gender). so maybe ""accent""
is the wrong word. i just talk like an idiot, all the time.","(!!!) = omg, go look this up immediately.<br />

into the oprah's book club scene (you may laugh, but a lot of those
were really good books!). more recently i've read empire falls by
richard russo, which i liked. having read a pulitzer prize winning
novel totally offsets my oprah books... right?<br />

generally. four weddings and a funeral, sleepless in seattle, love
actually, etc. there's a theme here... no, it's not hugh grant,

your bills, not that your income is roughly the gdp of a small

when i'm running errands or just hanging out around san francisco.
i can also be very loud when i want to be but i also can be quiet
when i need to be. i'm good at finding a balance between both. i
get my non-shyness from the fact that i've always taken part in
drama and i've also been in choir before. so, i consider myself a
performer in that way....i love to sing, dance and act. life is too
short...that's why i dance to the music that they play in grocery

take. when it's the right choice....<br />

other when we meet. we will just.. connect. make each other laugh.
trust each other easily. you will dance with me if not in public
then when we are alone. maybe you will teach me how to push myself
athletically in nature... whether that means surfing, hiking and
camping, the snow, the wild... i don't care. i will trust you
enough to take me on an adventure. or maybe you will push my
intellect, or my creativity. i will certainly enhance yours..<br />

i'm finding that i don't really much like dating. friendships are
okay, but i feel better if i am moving forward toward something,
more in the relationship department. and because of this, i tend to
come on more strongly than i mean to. if friendships are the only

bluntly, so that i know better not to get my heart attached.<br />

i am someone who seems to influence others lives, without

happens. i say that to say this... in the past, i have answered

i think... so don't just take for granted that what i answered,
when i answered it... is the same way that i believe it now. if you

to the right of your screen under ""speaks,"" so that english
wouldn't look so standoffish. unfortunately for english, a well
intentioned, self appointed okcupid patrol person stopped by to
point out that no one knows how to converse in attic greek or
vulgar latin. the patrol person looked eerily similar to one of the
jesuits who used to separate young male high school students and
us, their dates from the neighboring all girls catholic school,
with the admonition to, ""leave room for the holy spirit."" now, as
even those who put faith in such things will tell you, the holy
ghost has two left feet and is a wretched conversationalist.
despite his unfortunate resemblance, though, the okc patrol person
was correct. note: this anecdote is neither private nor an
admission.","you possess integrity.<br />

i'm a california girl with an appreciation for the small things in
life. i am settling back into life in the us after spending a year
in germany. i grew up in southern california but i've dreamed of
moving to sf since i was about 4 years old and watched the intro to
full house over and over again...<br />
<br />
i believe life is all about balance and moderation. i once took a
test to see if i was more type a or b, and the test concluded that
i was exactly half and half, haha. i enjoy the mountains as much as
the ocean and camping as much as fine dining. i'm not into going
out every night - i like the idea of going out some nights and then
having a few quiet nights at home. i am a glass half-full, silver
lining type person. my belief is that we have the power to create
our thoughts, good or bad, and so i like to spend my energy on the
good!<br />
<br />
family and friends are very important to me, so i spend a lot of my
time with them. i tend to keep a few really close friends rather
than tons of mediocre friends, and i wouldn't have it any other
way! i am a very even-keeled person who tends to remain calm
through a storm, so i adopt to role of ""steady rock"" in many
people's lives.<br />
<br />
things i love: dancing, music, cheesy jokes, chocolate chip
cookies, spontaneous adventures, and making lists =)<br />
<br />
so i hope that let you get to know a little about me (we should
save some mystery)...i am looking for someone who enjoys traveling,
conversation, being active, and enjoying the simple things in life.
i want to be with someone who pushes me to be, learn, and
experience more, and somebody who appreciates me for who i am:
good, bad, and dorky.<br />

as a native of the bay area, i find that i enjoy pretty much
anything. from a day off spent stoned playing chess or watching a
film, to an early morning for a quick tahoe snow trip. a
satisfyingly trip to the ocean, to a game of pick-up basketball.

them.<br />

coffee and a breakfast bagel (bagel+anything+ avocado)<br />
a good book/card game/chess with the next 2 cups<br />

-pick-up game of basketball<br />
-attend a daylight festival<br />
-other<br />

dinner would be something with pesto<br />

then<br />
work the next day= bake cookies and get fat with ice cream and a

<br />

xenophobia<br />

<br />
here is a tongue twister that i have stumbled upon sometime in me
youth<br />
<br />
cute school girl skirt ( and you are not saying fast enough )<br />
<br />
favorite child appropriate joke (due to no harsh language, not the
content)<br />
<br />
-this guy walks into a bar, and he is looking kinda sad. the
bartender shoves a shot in front of him and says ""what's got you
down, man?"" the man proceeds to pull out a little 12 inch tall man,
and a miniature grand piano. then the little guy starts busting out
beethoven. the bartender was surprised, he says ""why does that make
you sad? how did you even get that guy anyways?"" the man then pulls
out this old rusty genie lamp. the bartender stares in unbelief and
replies ""no way! may i?"" the man signals for him to go ahead. the
bartender gives it a quick rub and out pops this ooollldddd genie.
glasses, wrinkles, and everything. the genie says ""ahh i'll grant
you one wish!"" the man quickly responds ""oh! i want a million
bucks!"" the genie says ""granted!"" and poof disappears. a couple of
moments later a duck falls from the ceiling. then another. then it
starts raining ducks, and the bartender says ""i didn't say a
'million ducks' i said a 'million bucks!'"" the man replies, ""what,
you really think i asked for a 12 inch pianist?""<br />
<br />

2010<br />
after living in la. i grew up in florida, so i am a little wimpy
about the cold! i am toughing it out, though, because i think sf is
such a<br />
wonderful place. all the amazing things this city has to offer make
up for the weather. i like that the people here are smart,
adventurous, open minded, and friendly.<br />
<br />
i am in medical device sales and work for a company that
makes<br />
spinal implants. i was a sales rep for a long time and have
now<br />
moved into a specialist position. i travel around the western<br />
united states recruiting, training, and supporting sales reps
who<br />
sell products to spine and orthopedic surgeons. yes, i do go
into<br />
the or! you get used to it.<br />
<br />
on weekends, i enjoy spending time with the wonderful friends
i<br />
have met in sf. i love running and have recently tried to pick
up<br />
road biking. i enjoy hiking, but also enjoy a leisurely walk
around<br />
the city. i love being out and about and trying new restaurants,
but i also enjoy cooking dinner at home. i am usually up for any
type of sf exploring--gg park, museum, shops or flea market,
theater or live music, etc.<br />
<br />
i have traveled quite a bit--all over europe (lived in spain for
a<br />
semester in college), israel, jordan, morocco, brazil, costa
rica,<br />
several islands in the caribbean, tahiti, thailand, japan,
and<br />
china. i prefer trips that are not structured on a tour bus.<br />
sometimes instead of a big trip, i just go home to go to the
beach<br />
with my family and have just as much fun.<br />
<br />
my family is very important to me. they are 4 of the people i
look<br />
up to most in the world. i have 2 little sisters, and my
parents<br />
are still together. i have 2 precious twin 4 year old nephews
whom<br />
i couldn't love more. i visit them about 4 times a year in fl. i
am<br />
thankful to have grown up surrounded by loving, caring,
inspiring<br />
people. my grandparents are no longer alive, but i think<br />
of them often. they believed in giving--giving back to the<br />
community financially and with your time, giving to our family,
and<br />
they also frequently reminded us to live in the moment and
enjoy<br />
life.<br />
<br />
i love kids and definitely want to have a family one day when
i<br />
meet the right person. even though my family is far from here, i
picture myself staying in the sf area.<br />
<br />
part of what i love about sf is the historical buildings. i live
in<br />
a building that was built in 1901. i love the quirkiness, the<br />
character, the architecture, the molding, etc. of old homes.
i<br />
enjoy working on the house and always seem to be working on some

on this little site for a bit i've been snooping<br />
and decided to dedicate this rhyme to you, okcupid<br />
firsly, i must confess here with absolute candor<br />
i do not mean to dish out sacrilege or slander<br />
would like to avoid at all costs being abusive or rude<br />
cause i believe this site is at least somewhat cute...<br />
but i did almost fall over when starting to laugh<br />
there're enough essays here to write a book and a half!<br />
c'mon ladies, take a very good look at yourselves<br />
would one rather date or fill out forms like an a$$?<br />
don't know about you, but i have one tiny contention<br />
filing out questionnaires is not my intention<br />
been proven answer-matching dating is largely a scam<br />
since when did love and romance become an exam?<br />
might be tough for people to connect and converge<br />
if there is no old-fashioned simple and quick search<br />
so while you're busy determining your category and type<br />
please love yourself and don't trust the hype! ;)<br />
<br />
i am romantic, kind-hearted, and honest<br />

wander trails rather than follow freeways; i am both conventional
and a nonconformist. i know my history, my faults, and am (always
trying to) consciously live in the present. i am not perfect but
with a good sense of humor and patience (you and) i can laugh and
learn along the way. i'm spunky, vivacious, happy, spontaneous and
sensual. i am comfortable in my own skin. while i am grounded, i
sometimes have one foot off the ground for good reason! :) on that
note, please don't be too judgmental on what falls in/out bounds.
my friends say that i'm smart, articulate, generous and have good
intentions, and that i live very well.<br />
<br />
i have 2 teenagers who are my top priority, but i know how to make
time for myself.<br />
<br />
creativity, inspiration, kindness, lightness, confidence (not ego)
and intelligence are what attract me. i admire men who are
self-made, have purpose and dreams! there is no perfect formula or
list here... i can see you as an individual and don't judge. i tend
to communicate with words, touch, and if we're lucky, on a higher
level. it's important that i am with someone who is spiritual and
aware of how interconnected we all are. this, of course, requires
empathy and sensitivity.<br />
<br />
online, here on okc, i hope to find friends. it begins with dating,
and eventually we figure out if our minds, souls, and lives can
wander within the same course. it's not too complicated; i like to
keep it as simple as possible.<br />
<br />
i'm interested in only one truly honest relationship... building
just one spiritual, deeply intimate, connection. anything else is
fine, as friends.<br />
<br />
i am truthful, to a fault, and don't see any reason for pretenses,
deception, or games. if that's what you bring, then please save us
both the time.<br />
<br />
if you're the man i seek, then let's stop wasting time and jump on
that journey -- there are incredible things, ideas, and adventures
to explore. let's live life with laughter, light, and love! i'm
ready and willing to open my heart to the right man.","i'm a parent and friend. i hold a good stable job, and live within

<br />
1. there's no worse feeling than that millisecond you're sure you
are going to die after leaning your chair back a little too
far.<br />
2. nothing sucks more than that moment during an argument when you
realize you're wrong.<br />
3. bad decisions make good stories.<br />
<br />
on that note, my father once told me that, at the end of my life, i
would remember the experiences i had not the items i purchased. i
take this to heart each and every day and consciously put myself
into situations where i will have the opportunity to meet new
people, learn new things or at least have an interesting story to
tell a friend.<br />
<br />
people always describe me as a ""nice guy"" and i don't see this as a
bad thing. i'm an excellent friend, the first person people call
when they need a favor and always go the extra mile to help someone
out.","work. that's not actually true but sometimes it does feel like it.
i work full time doing consulting for a uk based telecom and, in my
spare time, i am the owner of a small residential construction
company (my other full time gig). but since both jobs allow me to
work from home, i feel like i have a lot of free time to
myself.<br />
<br />
in my free time i like to take a ride on the <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=motorcyle"">motorcyle</a> either through the hills or
perhaps up to napa. i also enjoy playing the guitar and recently
started playing the piano again. i've also taken up boxing at a
local gym here in oakland as a fun way to stay in shape.<br />

i recently completed the tough mudder in squaw valley and it has
inspired me to get into better shape and stay that way. so now i am
back in the gym a few times a week and am training for the race in
la next summer.","i'm very good with my hands. almost each and every nail in my home

""thank you"" and ""please"" and don't think treating others
respectfully makes me less of a man.<br />

the other thing that people will notice quickly is that i say what
is on my mind. i absolutely never have any intention of ever
hurting anyone's feelings but believe that direct communication is
much better than beating around the bush.","<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=books"">books</a> - i really
enjoyed life of pi and water for elephants. just finished reading

vampire stories, and the hunger games at the recommendation of a

wish he could figure out how to end a story. shadows of the wind
was one of my favorites.<br />

movies - i watch pretty much anything from the disney to horror. i
don't think a movie has to be an academy award winner in order to
be a fun evening but i've recently found that there has to be
something there to keep me interested. nothing recent really comes
to mind as being fantastic. as far as favorites go, shawshank
redemption is high on my list.<br />

good movie and a glass of wine","you're not going to find out that easily!","i would love to meet someone intelligent, attractive, loving,
responsible and supportive. if you can get lost in conversations or
just as easily share moments of comfortable silence then you are my
cup of tea. i don't like players so if you are one don't bother. if
you like bad boys then look elsewhere because i am definitely a
good boy! :)<br />
<br />
if i'm messaging you and you are not interested just say that you
are not interested. not responding at all is just plain rude!","middle eastern",72,100000,"science / tech / engineering","2012-06-16-17-01","emeryville, california","","straight","likes dogs and likes cats","agnosticism and laughing about it","m","taurus and it&rsquo;s fun to think about","when drinking","english (fluently), farsi (fluently)","single"
30,"","","socially","","graduated from law school","always learning -- like how i now know it is actually pretty tough
to describe myself in three words without sounding like a vain tool
[smart, charming, funny], or like i asked my mom to pick three
words to describe me [kind, loyal, handsome young man].<br />
<br />
i am friendly, joyful, and was told once as a kid that i was
incorrigible. i would like to think that still has some truth to
it.","living in san francisco (the sunny part, that you can probably
narrow down further w/ some basic detective skills), working in
oakland.<br />
<br />
i work for a small, union-side law firm. the other sixteen-ish
hours a day i am either living my life, or frittering it away with
my new dog, to whom i am trying to teach the ""return"" part of
fetch.<br />
<br />
other things too. i have solid friends in the city, keep decent
tabs on my family, and really like dolores park, even though it is
popular and i have a contrarian streak. recently started to have a
little love for the panhandle too.","my skill set is a pretty mixed bag. i am (was) really good at
planning themed bay-to-breakers groups (thanks for nothing ing),
board games, friendliness, not taking no for an answer when
speaking to corporate call centers (just recently stuck it to
comcast - damn right you are going to remove that ""service"" fee),
multiple choice tests, over-sharing...undoubtedly many other
things. and that last one was a joke. i mean, more so than the
others.","my overuse of parentheses. i just noticed that actually. and i have
been told i have a distinctive (re: funny sounding) laugh.","i do in fact like all five of those things - although i have been
told my taste in popular music runs +/- six months behind the
curve. pandora is helping with that. and reading on bart makes me
feel a little superior to people who have to drive to work - it's
so relaxing!<br />
<br />
but here is one of each: e.l. doctorow, wet hot american summer,
freaks and geeks, discovery, avocados.","my friends,<br />
the fam,<br />
dog,<br />
and a little romance.","whether that last answer was too cornball. borderline, but i think
it is okay.<br />
<br />
and i spend more time than is likely good for me reading and
thinking about politics, legal developments and other wonkish
stuff, but mainly while procrastinating at work.","either the friday fizzle, or powering through the friday fizzle.","i did a lot of over-sharing with the question comments...<br />
<br />
oh, and i looked at the 'personality' meter, and i am not that
sloppy. answer one too many questions about eating food off the
floor and double-dipping and you are branded for life apparently.","you think we will connect, you are fun.","white",76,-1,"law / legal services","2012-06-30-12-12","san francisco, california","","straight","has dogs","atheism","m","","no","english","single"
